summary: Signals that a cluster client is following an -ASK redirect.
syntax_fmt: ASKING
syntax_str: ''
title: ASKING
---
When a cluster client receives an `-ASK` redirect, the `ASKING` command is sent to the target node followed by the command which was redirected.
This is normally done automatically by cluster clients.

If an `-ASK` redirect is received during a transaction, only one ASKING command needs to be sent to the target node before sending the complete transaction to the target node.

See [ASK redirection in the Redis Cluster Specification]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec#ask-redirection" >}}) for details.
