Adds one or more items to a Bloom filter.

This command is similar to [`BF.ADD`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/bf.add/), except that you can add more than one item.

This command is similar to [`BF.INSERT`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/bf.insert/), except that the error rate, capacity, and expansion cannot be specified.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a Bloom filter to add the items to.

If `key` does not exist - a new Bloom filter is created with default error rate, capacity, and expansion (see [`BF.RESERVE`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/bf.reserve/)).
</details>

<details open><summary><code>item...</code></summary>

One or more items to add.
</details>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- [Array reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#arrays" >}}) where each element is either
  - [Integer reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers" >}}) - where "1" means that the item has been added successfully, and "0" means that such item was already added to the filter (which could be wrong)
  - [] when the item cannot be added because the filter is full
- [] on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.)

## Examples

{{< highlight bash >}}
redis> BF.MADD bf item1 item2 item2
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
3) (integer) 0
{{< / highlight >}}
