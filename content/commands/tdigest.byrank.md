---
Returns, for each input rank, a floating-point estimation of the value with that rank.
Multiple estimations can be retrieved in a single call.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is the key name of an existing t-digest sketch.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>rank</code></summary>

Ranks for which the values should be retrieved.

0 is the rank of the value of the smallest observation.

_n_-1 is the rank of the value of the largest observation, where _n_ denotes the number of observations that have been added to the sketch.

## Return information

{{< multitabs id=â€œtdigest-byrank-return-info" 
    tab1="RESP2" 
    tab2="RESP3" >}}

One of the following:

* [Array]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#arrays" >}}) of [bulk strings]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#bulk-strings" >}}) as floating-points, populated with value_1, value_2, ..., value_R:
    * an accurate result when `rank` is `0`, the value of the smallest observation.
    * an accurate result when `rank` is _n_-1, the value of the largest observation, where _n_ denotes the number of observations added to the sketch.
    * `inf` when `rank` is equal to _n_ or larger than _n_.
    * `nan` for all ranks when the given sketch is empty.
* [Simple error reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#simple-errors" >}}) in these cases: the given key does not exist or is of an incorrect type, rank parsing errors, or incorrect number of arguments.
