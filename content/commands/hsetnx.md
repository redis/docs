summary: Sets the value of a field in a hash only when the field doesn't exist.
syntax_fmt: HSETNX key field value
syntax_str: field value
title: HSETNX
---
Sets `field` in the hash stored at `key` to `value`, only if `field` does not
yet exist.
If `key` does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.
If `field` already exists, this operation has no effect.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
HSETNX myhash field "Hello"
HSETNX myhash field "World"
HGET myhash field
{{% /redis-cli %}}

One of the following:
* [Integer reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers): `0` if the field already exists in the hash and no operation was performed.
* [Integer reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers): `1` if the field is a new field in the hash and the value was set.
