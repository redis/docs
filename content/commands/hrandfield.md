When called with just the `key` argument, return a random field from the hash value stored at `key`.

If the provided `count` argument is positive, return an array of **distinct fields**.
The array's length is either `count` or the hash's number of fields ([`HLEN`]({{< relref "/commands/hlen" >}})), whichever is lower.

If called with a negative `count`, the behavior changes and the command is allowed to return the **same field multiple times**.
In this case, the number of returned fields is the absolute value of the specified `count`.

The optional `WITHVALUES` modifier changes the reply so it includes the respective values of the randomly selected hash fields.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
HSET coin heads obverse tails reverse edge null
HRANDFIELD coin
HRANDFIELD coin
HRANDFIELD coin -5 WITHVALUES
{{% /redis-cli %}}


## Specification of the behavior when count is passed

When the `count` argument is a positive value this command behaves as follows:

* No repeated fields are returned.
* If `count` is bigger than the number of fields in the hash, the command will only return the whole hash without additional fields.
* The order of fields in the reply is not truly random, so it is up to the client to shuffle them if needed.

When the `count` is a negative value, the behavior changes as follows:

* Repeating fields are possible.
* Exactly `count` fields, or an empty array if the hash is empty (non-existing key), are always returned.
* The order of fields in the reply is truly random.
