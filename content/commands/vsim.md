Return elements similar to a given vector or element. Use this command to perform approximate or exact similarity searches within a vector set.

You can query using either a vector (via `FP32` or `VALUES num`) or by referencing another element (using `ELE`). Optional parameters let you control the search behavior, such as score output, result count, and filtering options.

```shell
VSIM word_embeddings ELE apple
1) "apple"
2) "apples"
3) "pear"
4) "fruit"
5) "berry"
6) "pears"
7) "strawberry"
8) "peach"
9) "potato"
10) "grape"
```

You can include similarity scores and limit the number of results:

```shell
VSIM word_embeddings ELE apple WITHSCORES COUNT 3
1) "apple"
2) "0.9998867657923256"
3) "apples"
4) "0.8598527610301971"
5) "pear"
6) "0.8226882219314575"
```

Set the `EF` (exploration factor) to improve recall at the cost of performance. Use the `TRUTH` option to perform an exact linear scan, useful for benchmarking. The `NOTHREAD` option runs the search in the main thread and may increase server latency.

## Required arguments

<details open>
<summary><code>key</code></summary>

is the name of the key that holds the vector set data.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>ELE | FP32 | VALUES num</code></summary>

specifies how the input vector is provided. Use `ELE` to refer to an existing element, `FP32` for binary float format, or `VALUES num` for a list of stringified float values.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>vector or element</code></summary>

is either the vector data (for `FP32` or `VALUES`) or the name of the element (for `ELE`) to use as the similarity reference.
</details>

## Optional arguments

<details open>
<summary><code>WITHSCORES</code></summary>

returns the similarity score (from 1 to 0) alongside each result. A score of 1 is identical; 0 is the opposite.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>COUNT num</code></summary>

limits the number of returned results to `num`.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>EF search-exploration-factor</code></summary>

controls the search effort. Higher values explore more nodes, improving recall at the cost of speed. Typical values range from 50 to 1000.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>FILTER expression</code></summary>

applies a filter expression to restrict matching elements. See the filtered search section for syntax details.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>FILTER-EF max-filtering-effort</code></summary>

limits the number of filtering attempts for the `FILTER` expression. See the filtered search section for more.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>TRUTH</code></summary>

forces an exact linear scan of all elements, bypassing the HNSW graph. Use for benchmarking or to calculate recall. This is significantly slower (O(N)).
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>NOTHREAD</code></summary>

executes the search in the main thread instead of a background thread. Useful for small vector sets or benchmarks. This may block the server during execution.
</details>
