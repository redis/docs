This command returns the current number of entries in the slow log.

A new entry is added to the slow log whenever a command exceeds the execution time threshold defined by the `slowlog-log-slower-than` configuration directive.
The maximum number of entries in the slow log is governed by the `slowlog-max-len` configuration directive.
Once the slog log reaches its maximal size, the oldest entry is removed whenever a new entry is created.
The slow log can be cleared with the [`SLOWLOG RESET`]({{< relref "/commands/slowlog-reset" >}}) command.
