---
Increments the score of `member` in the sorted set stored at `key` by
`increment`.
If `member` does not exist in the sorted set, it is added with `increment` as
its score (as if its previous score was `0.0`).
If `key` does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified `member` as its
sole member is created.

An error is returned when `key` exists but does not hold a sorted set.

The `score` value should be the string representation of a numeric value, and
accepts double precision floating point numbers.
It is possible to provide a negative value to decrement the score.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
ZADD myzset 1 "one"
ZADD myzset 2 "two"
ZINCRBY myzset 2 "one"
ZRANGE myzset 0 -1 WITHSCORES
{{% /redis-cli %}}
