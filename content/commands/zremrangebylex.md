When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command removes all elements in the sorted set stored at `key` between the lexicographical range specified by `min` and `max`.

The meaning of `min` and `max` are the same of the [`ZRANGEBYLEX`]({{< relref "/commands/zrangebylex" >}}) command. Similarly, this command actually removes the same elements that [`ZRANGEBYLEX`]({{< relref "/commands/zrangebylex" >}}) would return if called with the same `min` and `max` arguments.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
ZADD myzset 0 aaaa 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e
ZADD myzset 0 foo 0 zap 0 zip 0 ALPHA 0 alpha
ZRANGE myzset 0 -1
ZREMRANGEBYLEX myzset [alpha [omega
ZRANGE myzset 0 -1
{{% /redis-cli %}}
