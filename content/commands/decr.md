---
Decrements the number stored at `key` by one.
If the key does not exist, it is set to `0` before performing the operation.
An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a
string that can not be represented as integer.
This operation is limited to **64 bit signed integers**.

See [`INCR`]({{< relref "/commands/incr" >}}) for extra information on increment/decrement operations.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
SET mykey "10"
DECR mykey
SET mykey "234293482390480948029348230948"
DECR mykey
{{% /redis-cli %}}
