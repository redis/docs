---
This command returns the list of consumers that belong to the `<groupname>` consumer group of the stream stored at `<key>`.

The following information is provided for each consumer in the group:

* **name**: the consumer's name
* **pending**: the number of entries in the PEL: pending messages for the consumer, which are messages that were delivered but are yet to be acknowledged
* **idle**: the number of milliseconds that have passed since the consumer's last attempted interaction (Examples: [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref "/commands/xreadgroup" >}}), [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref "/commands/xclaim" >}}), [`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref "/commands/xautoclaim" >}}))
* **inactive**: the number of milliseconds that have passed since the consumer's last successful interaction (Examples: [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref "/commands/xreadgroup" >}}) that actually read some entries into the PEL, [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref "/commands/xclaim" >}})/[`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref "/commands/xautoclaim" >}}) that actually claimed some entries)

Note that before Redis 7.2.0, **idle** used to denote the time passed since last successful interaction.
In 7.2.0, **inactive** was added and **idle** was changed to denote the time passed since last attempted interaction.

## Examples

```

1) 1) name
   2) "Alice"
   3) pending

   7) inactive
   8) (integer) 18104698
2) 1) name
   2) "Bob"
   3) pending
