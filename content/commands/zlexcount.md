When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command returns the number of elements in the sorted set at `key` with a value between `min` and `max`.

The `min` and `max` arguments have the same meaning as described for
[`ZRANGEBYLEX`]({{< relref "/commands/zrangebylex" >}}).

Note: the command has a complexity of just O(log(N)) because it uses elements ranks (see [`ZRANK`]({{< relref "/commands/zrank" >}})) to get an idea of the range. Because of this there is no need to do a work proportional to the size of the range.

## Examples

{{% redis-cli %}}
ZADD myzset 0 a 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e
ZADD myzset 0 f 0 g
ZLEXCOUNT myzset - +
ZLEXCOUNT myzset [b [f
{{% /redis-cli %}}
