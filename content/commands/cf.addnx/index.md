---
Adds an item to a cuckoo filter if the item does not exist.

This command is similar to the combination of [`CF.EXISTS`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.exists/) and [`CF.ADD`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.add/). It does not add an item into the filter if its fingerprint already exists.

<note><b>Notes:</b>

- This command is slower than [`CF.ADD`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.add/) because it first checks whether the item exists.
- Since [`CF.EXISTS`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.exists/) can result in false positive, `CF.ADDNX` may not add an item because it is supposedly already exist, which may be wrong.

</note>

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a cuckoo filter to add items to.

If `key` does not exist - a new cuckoo filter is created.
</details>

<details open><summary><code>item</code></summary>

is an item to add.
</details>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- [Integer reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers" >}}), where `0` means that the item's fingerprint already exist in the filter, and `1` means that the item has been successfully added to the filter.
- [] on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, etc.) and also when the filter is full.

## Examples

{{< highlight bash >}}
redis> CF.ADDNX cf item
(integer) 1
redis> CF.ADDNX cf item
(integer) 0
{{< / highlight >}}
