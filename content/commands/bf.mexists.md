2) (integer) 1
redis> BF.MEXISTS bf item1 item2 item3
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
3) (integer) 0

## Return information

{{< multitabs id="bf-mexists-return-info" 
    tab1="RESP2" 
    tab2="RESP3" >}}

One of the following:
* [Array reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#arrays" >}}) of [integer replies]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers" >}}), where `1` means that, with high probability, `item` was already added to the filter, and `0` means that `key` does not exist or that `item` was definitely not added to the filter.
* [Simple error reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#simple-errors" >}}) in these cases: in these cases: invalid arguments, wrong key type, or when the key was not found.
