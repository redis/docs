summary: Adds one or more members to a set. Creates the key if it doesn't exist.
syntax_fmt: SADD key member [member ...]
syntax_str: member [member ...]
title: SADD
---
Add the specified members to the set stored at `key`.
Specified members that are already a member of this set are ignored.
If `key` does not exist, a new set is created before adding the specified
members.

An error is returned when the value stored at `key` is not a set.

## Examples

{{< clients-example cmds_set sadd >}}
redis> SADD myset "Hello" "World"
(integer) 2
redis> SADD myset "World"
(integer) 0
redis> SMEMBERS myset
1) "Hello"
2) "World"
{{< /clients-example >}}

Give these commands a try in the interactive console:

{{% redis-cli %}}
SADD myset "Hello" "World"
SADD myset "World"
SMEMBERS myset
{{% /redis-cli %}}

## Return information

{{< multitabs id="sadd-return-info" 
    tab1="RESP2" 
    tab2="RESP3" >}}

[Integer reply](../../develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers): the number of elements that were added to the set, not including all the elements already present in the set.
