---
Returns an estimation of the number of times a given item was added to a cuckoo filter.

If you just want to check that a given item was added to a cuckoo filter, use [`CF.EXISTS`]({{< relref "commands/cf.exists/" >}}).

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a cuckoo filter.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>item</code></summary>

is an item to check.
</details>

## Examples

{{< highlight bash >}}
redis> CF.INSERT cf ITEMS item1 item2 item2
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
3) (integer) 1
redis> CF.COUNT cf item1
(integer) 1
redis> CF.COUNT cf item2
(integer) 2
{{< / highlight >}}

## Return information

{{< multitabs id=â€œcf-count-return-info" 
    tab1="RESP2" 
    tab2="RESP3" >}}

One of the following:
* [Integer reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers" >}}), where a positive value is an estimation of the number of times `item` was added to the filter. An overestimation is possible, but not an underestimation. `0` means that `key` does not exist or that `item` had not been added to the filter. See the note in [`CF.DEL`]({{< relref "commands/cf.del/" >}}).
* [Simple error]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#simple-errors" >}}) in these cases: invalid arguments or wrong key type.
