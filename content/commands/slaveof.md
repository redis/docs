**A note about the word slave used in this man page and command name**: starting with Redis version 5, if not for backward compatibility, the Redis project no longer uses the word slave. Please use the new command [`REPLICAOF`]({{< relref "/commands/replicaof" >}}). The command `SLAVEOF` will continue to work for backward compatibility.

The `SLAVEOF` command can change the replication settings of a replica on the fly.
If a Redis server is already acting as replica, the command `SLAVEOF` NO ONE will
turn off the replication, turning the Redis server into a MASTER.
In the proper form `SLAVEOF` hostname port will make the server a replica of
another server listening at the specified hostname and port.

If a server is already a replica of some master, `SLAVEOF` hostname port will stop
the replication against the old server and start the synchronization against the
new one, discarding the old dataset.

The form `SLAVEOF` NO ONE will stop replication, turning the server into a
MASTER, but will not discard the replication.
So, if the old master stops working, it is possible to turn the replica into a
master and set the application to use this new master in read/write.
Later when the other Redis server is fixed, it can be reconfigured to work as a
replica.
