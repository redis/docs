title: CF.EXISTS
---
Determines whether a given item was added to a cuckoo filter.

This command is similar to [`CF.MEXISTS`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.mexists/), except that only one item can be checked.

## Required arguments

<details open><summary><code>key</code></summary>

is key name for a cuckoo filter.

</details>

<details open><summary><code>item</code></summary>

is an item to check.
</details>

## Return value

Returns one of these replies:

- [Integer reply]({{< relref "/develop/reference/protocol-spec#integers" >}}), where `1` means that, with high probability, `item` had already been added to the filter, and `0` means that `key` does not exist or that `item` had not been added to the filter. See note in [`CF.DEL`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/cf.del/).
- [] on error (invalid arguments, wrong key type, and so on)

## Examples

{{< highlight bash >}}
redis> CF.ADD cf item1
(integer) 1
redis> CF.EXISTS cf item1
(integer) 1
redis> CF.EXISTS cf item2
(integer) 0
{{< / highlight >}}
