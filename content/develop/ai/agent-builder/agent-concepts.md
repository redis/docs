## How AI agents work

AI agents are autonomous systems that go far beyond simple chatbots. They combine large language models (LLMs) with external tools, memory, and planning capabilities to accomplish complex tasks.

**Key differences from chatbots:**
- Maintain state across multiple conversations
- Reason through problems step-by-step
- Take actions in the real world
- Learn and adapt from interactions

### Core agent architecture

### The agent processing cycle

Every user interaction follows a 6-step cycle that makes agents intelligent:

{{< image filename="/images/ai_agent/simple-processing-cycle.svg" alt="AI agent processing cycle" >}}

Why this cycle matters:
- Maintains context across multiple conversations
- Learns from experience to improve future responses
- Handles complex tasks that require multiple steps
- Recovers from failures and adapts plans in real-time

> Example: When you ask "Book me a flight to Paris and find a hotel," the agent breaks this into separate tasks, remembers your travel preferences, searches for options, and coordinates the booking process.

## Why Redis powers AI agents

Redis is the **ideal foundation** for AI agents because it excels at the three things agents need most: **speed**, **memory**, and **search**.

## Agent architecture patterns

### Single-agent systems

Simple agents that handle all tasks within one system:
- Easier to develop and maintain
- Good for focused use cases
- All logic contained in one place
- Suitable for most applications

### Multi-agent systems

Multiple specialized agents working together:
- Each agent handles specific domains or tasks
- agents can communicate and coordinate
- More complex but more scalable
- Good for enterprise applications

### Hierarchical agents

Agents organized in layers with different responsibilities:
- High-level agents handle planning and coordination
- Low-level agents execute specific tasks
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug and maintain


## Redis data structures for agent memory

Understanding how to map agent memory needs to Redis data structures is crucial for building efficient agents:

### Redis streams for conversation history

- Use case: Ordered conversation logs with timestamps and metadata
- Key benefits: Automatic ordering, range queries, consumer groups, guaranteed delivery
- Implementation: Store user/agent message pairs with rich contextual metadata

## Reliability features

Production-ready agents include built-in reliability features:

### Error handling

- Gracefully handle API failures and unexpected inputs
- Provide helpful error messages when things go wrong
- Continue functioning even when some components fail

### Retry logic

- Automatically retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- Handle temporary network issues and rate limiting
- Ensure important operations complete successfully

### Logging and monitoring

- Track what your agent does for debugging and improvement
- Monitor performance metrics like response times
- Log errors and unusual behavior for investigation

### Performance optimization

- Cache frequently accessed information
- Use efficient data structures for fast retrieval
- Scale resources based on demand

## Production deployment considerations

### Monitoring and Observability

- Agent performance metrics: Response times, success rates, user satisfaction
- Redis metrics: Memory usage, connection counts, operation latencies
- LLM usage tracking: Token consumption, API costs, rate limiting
- Business metrics: Task completion rates, user engagement, conversion

### Security and Privacy

- Data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Access controls: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Data retention: Automatic cleanup of personal data per regulations
- Audit logging: Track all data access and modifications

### Scaling Strategies

- Horizontal scaling: Multiple agent instances with shared Redis state
- Load balancing: Distribute requests across agent instances
- Redis clustering: Scale data storage across multiple nodes
- Caching layers: CDN for static content, Redis for dynamic data
- [Learn about Redis scaling →](/operate/rs/clusters/)

### Cost Optimization

- LLM cost management: Use appropriate models for different tasks
- Redis memory optimization: Efficient data structures and TTL policies
- API rate limiting: Prevent excessive external API calls
- Resource monitoring: Track and optimize compute and storage costs
