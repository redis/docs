A Redis version represents the complete set of features available in a specific Redis version.

The following Redis versions are supported and maintained:

- Redis version [7.4]({{< relref "/develop/whats-new/redis-versions/7-4" >}})
- Redis version [7.2]({{< relref "/develop/whats-new/redis-versions/7-2" >}})
- Redis version [6.2]({{< relref "/develop/whats-new/redis-versions/6-2" >}})

To use a new feature introduced in a later Redis version, you must upgrade the corresponding components included in that Redis version.
