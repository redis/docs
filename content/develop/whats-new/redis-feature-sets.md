A Redis feature set includes a specific Redis database version along with the advanced capabilities and data structures provided by compatible module versions.

To use a new feature introduced in a later feature set, you must upgrade the corresponding components according to the following table.

| Redis feature set | What's new |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Feature set version:** 7.4<br /><br />**Component versions:**<br />[Redis 7.4]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisce-7.4-release-notes.md">}})<br />[Search 2.10]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.10-release-notes.md" >}})<br />[JSON 2.8]({{<relref "operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.8-release-notes.md">}})<br />[Time series 1.12]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.12-release-notes.md">}})<br />[Bloom 2.8]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.8-release-notes.md">}}) | **Hash**: <br>- [Expiration of individual hash fields]({{<relref "/develop/data-types/hashes#field-expiration">}}). <br> **Streams**: <br>- To start reading from the last stream message, use [`XREAD`]({{<relref "/commands/xread">}}) with the new ID value `+`.<br> **Time series**: <br>Insertion-filter for close samples. <br> **JSON**: <br>- A fix to not duplicate `AOF` commands multiple times in [`JSON.MSET`]({{< relref "commands/json.mset/" >}}). <br> **Probabilistic**: <br>- Returns an error if [`CMS.MERGE`]({{< relref "commands/cms.merge/" >}}) results in an overflow or underflow. <br> **Redis Query Engine**: <br>- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types, reducing memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy. <br>- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities. <br>- You can match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters. <br>- Expanded geospatial search with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, improved reporting of the memory consumed by the index, and exposed full-text scoring in aggregation pipelines. |
