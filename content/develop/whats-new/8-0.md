Redis 8 introduces major new capabilities, including eight additional data structures—Vector Set (beta), JSON, Time Series, and five probabilistic data types: Bloom Filter, Cuckoo Filter, Count-Min Sketch, Top-K, and T-Digest. Some of these were previously available only as Redis modules and are now fully integrated into Redis 8, simplifying deployment and unlocking new use cases in real-time analytics, caching, and AI-powered applications.

Redis 8 also includes the Redis Query Engine, enabling advanced secondary indexing, full-text and vector search, and complex queries across JSON and hash data types. This makes Redis a more powerful and flexible real-time data platform for modern apps.

In addition, Redis Community Edition has been renamed to Redis Open Source, reflecting a unified and modern distribution that delivers the full capabilities of Redis to the community—no modules, no fragmentation, just Redis.

Below is a detailed breakdown of these updates.

## Changes

### One Redis
Over time, Redis introduced several modules to address new use cases such as search, vector similarity, time series analysis, and probabilistic modeling. While these modules extended Redis’s functionality, managing version compatibility and module installation introduced friction.

Redis Stack partially solved this by bundling modules together, but it also created fragmentation across the ecosystem.

Redis 8 merges Redis Stack and Redis Community Edition into a single unified distribution: Redis Open Source. All previously modular functionality is now built into the Redis Open Source package, eliminating the need to manage separate modules. You now get a single, consistent feature set across all deployments.

#### Vector set [beta]
The new `Vector set` data structure supports high-dimensional vector similarity search, which is ideal for AI use cases such as semantic search and recommendation systems. Vector set complements Redis’s existing vector search capabilities via the Query Engine and is currently available in beta. APIs and behaviors may change in future releases.

#### JSON
Redis 8 introduces a native JSON data structure, enabling you to store and manipulate hierarchical documents directly. JSONPath expressions are supported for targeted reads and updates. Atomic operations allow modification of individual fields without fetching the entire document, making it ideal for session management, user profiles, and modern web applications.

#### Time series
A time series in Redis allows storing and querying a series of timestamped data points (samples), typically representing how a metric changes over time.

The time series data structure is optimized for high-ingestion workloads with time-stamped data—such as IoT, telemetry, and financial applications. Redis 8 applies efficient compression algorithms to reduce memory usage and supports downsampling (compaction) rules for long-term retention.

#### Probabilistic data structures
Redis 8 expands on HyperLogLog by adding five additional probabilistic data structures:

- Bloom Filter and Cuckoo Filter: Efficient membership checks in large streams
- Count-Min Sketch: Approximate frequency estimation of elements
- Top-K: Identifies the most frequent elements
- t-Digest: Enables quantile estimation and percentile queries

These structures trade absolute accuracy for significant performance and memory gains, and are ideal for streaming and telemetry workloads.
### Query Enhancements
#### Redis Query Engine
The Redis Query Engine allows users to use Redis as a document database, a vector database, a secondary index, and a search engine. With Redis Query Engine, users can define indexes for hash and JSON documents, and use a rich query language for vector search, full-text search, geospatial queries, and aggregations.

Use cases include:

- Vector Search: Search based on semantic similarity using vector embeddings stored in `JSON` or `hashes`
- Exact Matching: Lookups using filters, tags, and ranges
- Full-Text Search: Supports stemming, synonyms, and fuzzy matching

The Redis Query Engine powers a wide range of applications, from AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to full-featured search engines.

### Access Control Enhancements
Access Control Lists (ACLs) have been updated to support the new data structures introduced in Redis 8. Existing ACL categories such as `@read` and `@write` now include commands for `JSON`, `time series`, `VECTOR`, and `probabilistic` data structures.

These updates allow for more precise control over which operations users can perform on each data structure.

### New hash commands
Redis 8 builds on Redis 7.4’s introduction of field-level expiration in hashes and adds three new commands for working with hashes:
- [HGETEX](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hgetex/): Fetch a hash field and optionally set an expiration
- [HSETEX](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hsetex/): Set a hash field and optionally set an expiration
- [HGETDEL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hgetdel/): Fetch and delete a hash field

These commands simplify common caching and session management usage patterns.

### Performance improvements
Redis 8 delivers the largest performance leap in Redis history with over 30 optimizations, including:
- Up to 87% lower command latency
- 2x throughput in multi-threaded workloads
- 35% memory savings for replica nodes
- 16x more query processing capacity with horizontal and vertical scaling

These improvements benefit both single-node and clustered deployments. More details are available in the [Redis 8 GA](https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/) blog post.

### Breaking changes
#### ACL behavior
Commands from included modules are now covered under standard categories (e.g., `+@read`, `+@write`). A user with `+@all` `-@write` will no longer be able to execute `FT.SEARCH` as they could before.
Explicit inclusion of new command categories is required to maintain access.

#### Redis Query Engine
The following changes affect behavior and validation in the Redis Query Engine:
- Enforces validation for `LIMIT` arguments (offset must be 0 if limit is 0).
- Enforces parsing rules for `FT.CURSOR READ` and `FT.ALIASADD`.
- Parentheses are now required for exponentiation precedence in `APPLY` expressions.
- Invalid input now returns errors instead of empty results.
- Default values revisited for reducers like `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `STDDEV`, `QUANTILE`, and others.
- Updates to scoring (`BM25` is now the default instead of `TF-IDF`).
- Improved handling of expired records, memory constraints, and malformed fields.
