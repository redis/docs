Redis 8 release adds 8 more data structures, including vector set (beta), JSON, time series, and five probabilistic structures, including Bloom filter, cuckoo filter, count-min sketch, top-k, and t-digest (some previously available as separate Redis modules). These new data structures help you solve your current use cases better and build for the next generation of fast and real-time apps. 

Additionally, we’ve changed the name of our free product from Redis Community Edition to Redis Open Source.

Below is a detailed breakdown of these updates.

## Changes

### One Redis
Over the years, we have created new Redis modules that help you build real-time apps for web, mobile, and GenAI faster. However, we’ve heard from many of you how it often becomes confusing figuring out how to get started with modules, especially with matching the right module version to the Redis version. The introduction of Redis Stack helped and saw significant adoption but also introduced fragmentation in the community.

With this release, we’re combining our Redis Stack and community offerings into a single Redis Open Source distribution. All the modules are already included in this package. Going forward, Redis Open Source delivers the same feature set to you everywhere. When you use Redis Open Source, you know you’re always getting the latest and best of Redis with the full suite of capabilities that are available to the community. 

These are some of the features and capabilities that come packaged in Redis 8 in Redis Open Source.

#### Vector set data structure [beta]
Vector set is a new data type for vector similarity search, which allows the storage and querying of high-dimensional vector embeddings, enhancing Redis for AI use cases that involve semantic search and recommendation systems. Vector set complements the existing vector search capability in the Redis Query Engine.

The vector set data type is available in beta. We may change, or even break, the features and the API in future versions. We are open to your feedback as you try out this new data type whilst we work towards general availability.

#### JSON data structure
The JSON data structure improves how you solve for traditional Redis use cases. It also lets you manage sessions more easily, like by using arrays and objects to model hierarchical session data. In Redis 8, the JSON data structure lets you store JSON documents as keys in Redis. Redis provides commands to retrieve and manipulate documents using the JSONPath language for more granular and efficient access to specific elements. Redis also supports atomic updates so you can make modifications to parts of a JSON document without having to retrieve the entire document first.


#### Time series data structure
The time series data structure simplifies how you tackle use cases with fast changing timestamped data such as those from IoT sensors, system telemetry, stock prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and crypto prices. In Redis 8, it’s very fast to get and use time series data. This is because Redis uses very efficient compression algorithms to keep the data memory footprint low. In addition, compaction (downsampling) rules can be defined for efficient long-term storage.

#### Probabilistic data structures
Probabilistic data structures let you answer common questions about your data streams and large datasets much faster. The significant advantages given in terms of efficiency in memory usage and processing speed is a trade-off with absolute accuracy. In Redis 8, in addition to HyperLogLog, which allows estimating the cardinality of a set, there are now 5 more probabilistic data structures:

- Bloom filter and Cuckoo filter—for checking if a given value has already appeared in a data stream
- Count-min sketch—for estimating how many times a given value appeared in a data stream
- Top-k—for finding the most frequent values in the data stream
- t-digest—for querying which fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller/larger than a given value.

#### Redis Query Engine
The Redis Query Engine unlocks fast data access beyond a key lookup. With Redis 8 you can create a secondary index of data that resides in hashes and JSON data structures.  Some of the most common ways to use the Redis Query Engine include for vector search, data queries that return exact matches by a criteria or tag, and search queries that return the best matches by keywords or semantic meaning. The query engine also supports features like stemming, synonym expansion, and fuzzy matching for more comprehensive search results. Vector embeddings that represent data points within hashes or JSON documents can also be stored so the query engine in Redis 8 can be leveraged for vector similarity search.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
While Redis 8 is secure by default, Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow more fine-grained security control. With ACLs, you can define which users can connect, what commands they can perform, and which keys they can access. This helps you restrict unauthorized access and maintain data integrity in your Redis environment. In Redis 8, we introduce new ACL categories for the new data structures. Existing ACL categories such as @read and @write now include commands that support the newly included data structures.

### New commands building
When you build on Redis 8, you also get all the new features and capabilities that came in Redis 7.4, including our introduction of hash field expiration. One of the most frequently requested feature, you can find 3 new hash commands in Redis 8:

- HGETDEL – Get hash fields and delete them
- HGETEX – Get hash fields and optionally set their expiration time
-  HSETEX – Set hash fields and optionally set their expiration time

### Significant performance improvements
Redis 8 introduces over 30 performance improvements for both single-core and multi-core environments, delivering the greatest leap in performance in a single new Redis version. Such improvements include:
- Up to 87% reduction in command latency
- 2x more ops per second throughput by enabling multithreading
- Up to 35% less memory used for replication
- Up to 16x more query processing power with horizontal & vertical scaling
- And many other. More details are available on the [Redis 8 blogpost](https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/)
