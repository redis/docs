description: Perform simple exact match queries
linkTitle: Exact match
title: Exact match queries
weight: 1
---

An exact match query allows you to select all documents where a field matches a specific value. 

You can use exact match queries on several field types. The query syntax varies depending on the type. 

The examples in this article use a schema with the following fields:

| Field name | Field type |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `description`| `TEXT` |
| `condition` | `TAG` |
| `price` | `NUMERIC` |

You can find more details about creating the index and loading the demo data in the [quick start guide]({{< relref "/develop/get-started/document-database" >}}).

## Numeric field

To perform an exact match query on a numeric field, you need to construct a range query with the same start and end value:

```
FT.SEARCH index "@field:[value value]"

or

FT.SEARCH index "@field:[value]" DIALECT 2 # requires v2.10

or

FT.SEARCH index "@field==value" DIALECT 2 # requires v2.10
```

As described in the [article about range queries]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/query/range" >}}), you can also use the `FILTER` argument:

```
FT.SEARCH index "*" FILTER field start end
```

The following examples show you how to query for bicycles with a price of exactly 270 USD:

{{< clients-example query_em em1 >}}
> FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "@price:[270 270]"
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:0"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((-74.0610 40.7578, ...

> FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "@price:[270]" # requires v2.10
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:0"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((-74.0610 40.7578, ...

> FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "@price==270" # requires v2.10
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:0"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((-74.0610 40.7578, ...

> FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "*" FILTER price 270 270
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:0"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((-74.0610 40.7578, ...
{{< /clients-example >}}


## Tag field

A tag is a short sequence of text, for example, "new" or "Los Angeles". 

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
If you need to query for short texts, use a tag query instead of a full-text query. Tag fields are more space-efficient for storing index entries and often lead to lower query complexity for exact match queries.
{{% /alert  %}}

You can construct a tag query for a single tag in the following way:

```
FT.SEARCH index "@field:{tag}"
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
The curly brackets are mandatory for tag queries.
{{% /alert  %}}

This short example shows you how to query for new bicycles:

{{< clients-example query_em em2 >}}
> FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "@condition:{new}"
 1) (integer) 5
 2) "bicycle:0"
 3) 1) "$"
    2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((-74.0610 40.7578, -73.9510 40.7578, -73.9510 40.6678, -74.0610 40.6678, -74.0610 40.7578))\",\"store_location\":\"-74.0060,40.7128\",\"brand\":\"Velorim\",\"model\":\"Jigger\",\"price\":270,\"description\":\"Small and powerful, the Jigger is the best ride for the smallest of tikes!

Use double quotes and [DIALECT 2]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/dialects" >}}#dialect-2) for exact match queries involving tags that contain special characters. As of v2.10, the only character that needs escaping in queries involving double-quoted tags is the double-quote character. Here's an example of using double-quoted tags that contain special characters:

{{< clients-example query_em em3 >}}
> FT.CREATE idx:email ON JSON PREFIX 1 key: SCHEMA $.email AS email TAG
OK
> JSON.SET key:1 $ '{"email": "test@redis.com"}'
OK
> FT.SEARCH idx:email '@email:{"test@redis.com"}' DIALECT 2
1) (integer) 1
2) "key:1"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"email\":\"test@redis.com\"}"
{{< /clients-example>}}

## Full-text field

A detailed explanation of full-text queries is available in the [full-text queries documentation]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/query/full-text" >}}). You can also query for an exact match of a phrase within a text field:

```
FT.SEARCH index "@field:\"phrase\""
```

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
The phrase must be wrapped by escaped double quotes for an exact match query.

You can't use a phrase that starts with a [stop word]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/stopwords" >}}).
{{% /alert  %}}

Here is an example for finding all bicycles that have a description containing the exact text 'rough terrain':

{{< clients-example query_em em4 >}}
FT.SEARCH idx:bicycle "@description:\"rough terrain\""
1) (integer) 1
2) "bicycle:8"
3) 1) "$"
   2) "{\"pickup_zone\":\"POLYGON((1.9450 41.4301, 2.4018 41.4301, 2.4018 41.1987, 1.9450 41.1987, 1.9450 41.4301))\",\"store_location\":\"2.1734, 41.3851\",\"brand\":\"nHill\",\"model\":\"Summit\",\"price\":1200,\"description\":\"This budget mountain bike from nHill performs well both on bike paths and on the trail.
