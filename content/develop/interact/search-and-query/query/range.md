description: Perform numeric range queries
linkTitle: Range
title: Range queries
weight: 2
---

A range query on a numeric field returns the values that are in between a given start and end value:

```
FT.SEARCH index "@field:[start end]"
```

You can also use the `FILTER` argument, but you need to know that the query execution plan is different because the filter is applied after the query string (e.g., `*`) is evaluated:

```
FT.SEARCH index "*" FILTER field start end
```

## Start and end values

Start and end values are by default inclusive, but you can prepend `(` to a value to exclude it from the range.

The values `-inf`, `inf`, and `+inf` are valid values that allow you to define open ranges.

## Result set

An open-range query can lead to a large result set. 

By default, [`FT.SEARCH`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/ft.search/) returns only the first ten results. The `LIMIT` argument helps you to scroll through the result set. The `SORTBY` argument ensures that the documents in the result set are returned in the specified order.

```
FT.SEARCH index "@field:[start end]" SORTBY field LIMIT page_start page_end
```

You can find further details about using the `LIMIT` and `SORTBY` in the [[`FT.SEARCH`]({{< baseurl >}}/commands/ft.search/) command reference](/commands/ft.search/).

## Examples

The examples in this section use a schema with the following fields:

| Field name | Field type |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| `price` | `NUMERIC` |

The following query finds bicycles within a price range greater than or equal to 500 USD and smaller than or equal to 1000 USD (`500 <= price <= 1000`):

{{< clients-example query_range range1 >}}
