Redis Stack supports the following Redis Query Engine features. This article provides you an overview.

## Indexing features

* Secondary indexing
* Vector indexing
* Index on [JSON]({{< relref "/develop/data-types/json/" >}}) documents
* Full-text indexing of multiple fields in a document
* Incremental indexing without performance loss
* Document deletion and updating with index garbage collection


## Query features

* Multi-field queries
* Query on [JSON]({{< relref "/develop/data-types/json/" >}}) documents
* [Aggregation]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/aggregations" >}})
* Boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators between subqueries
* Optional query clauses
* Retrieval of full document contents or only their IDs
* Exact phrase search and slop-based search
* Numeric filters and ranges
* Geo-filtering using Redis [geo commands]({{< relref "/commands/" >}}?group=geo)
* [Vector search]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/vectors" >}})


## Full-text search features

* [Prefix-based searches]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/query/#prefix-matching" >}})
* Field weights
* [Auto-complete]({{< baseurl >}}/develop/interact/search-and-query/administration/overview#auto-complete) and fuzzy prefix suggestions
* [Stemming]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/stemming" >}})-based query expansion for [many languages]({{< baseurl >}}/develop/interact/search-and-query/advanced-concepts/stemming#supported-languages) using [Snowball](http://snowballstem.org/)
* Support for custom functions for query expansion and scoring (see [Extensions]({{< relref "/develop/interact/search-and-query/administration/extensions" >}}))
* Unicode support (UTF-8 input required)
* Document ranking

## Cluster support

The Redis Query Engine features of Redis Stack are also available for distributed databases that can scale to billions of documents and hundreds of servers.
