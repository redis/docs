This guide offers recommendations to get the best reliability and
performance in your production environment.

## Recommendations

### Handling errors

Node-Redis provides [multiple events to handle various scenarios](https://github.com/redis/node-redis?tab=readme-ov-file#events), among which the most critical is the `error` event.

This event is triggered whenever an error occurs within the client.

It is crucial to listen for error events.

If a client does not register at least one error listener and an error occurs, the system will throw that error, potentially causing the Node.js process to exit unexpectedly.
See [the EventEmitter docs](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events) for more details.

```typescript
const client = createClient({
  // ... client options
});
// Always ensure there's a listener for errors in the client to prevent process crashes due to unhandled errors
client.on('error', error => {
    console.error(`Redis client error:`, error);
});
```

### Handling reconnections

When the socket closes unexpectedly (without calling the `quit()` or `disconnect()` methods),
the client can automatically restore the connection.  A simple
[exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) strategy
for reconnection is enabled by default, but you can replace this with your
own custom strategy. See
[Reconnect after disconnection]({{< relref "/develop/clients/nodejs/connect#reconnect-after-disconnection" >}})
for more information.

### Connection timeouts

To set a timeout for a connection, use the `connectTimeout` option
(the default timeout is 5 seconds):

```js
const client = createClient({
  socket: {
    // setting a 10-second timeout  
    connectTimeout: 10000 // in milliseconds
  }
});
client.on('error', error => console.error('Redis client error:', error));
```

### Command execution reliability

By default, `node-redis` reconnects automatically when the connection is lost
(but see [Handling reconnections](#handling-reconnections), if you want to
customize this behavior). While the connection is down, any commands that you
execute will be queued and sent to the server when the connection is restored.
This might occasionally cause problems if the connection fails while a
[non-idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) command
is being executed. In this case, the command could change the data on the server
without the client removing it from the queue. When the connection is restored,
the command will be sent again, resulting in incorrect data.

If you need to avoid this situation, set the `disableOfflineQueue` option
to `true` when you create the client. This will cause the client to discard
unexecuted commands rather than queuing them:

```js
const client = createClient({
  disableOfflineQueue: true,
      .
      .
});
```

Use a separate connection with the queue disabled if you want to avoid queuing
only for specific commands.
