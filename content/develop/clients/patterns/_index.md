The following documents describe some novel development patterns you can use with Redis.

## Patterns in this section

- [Bulk loading](bulk-loading/) - Efficiently load large datasets into Redis
- [Distributed locks](distributed-locks/) - Implement the Redlock algorithm for distributed locking
- [Twitter clone](twitter-clone/) - Comprehensive example application using multiple Redis patterns
- [Secondary indexes](indexes/) - Additional examples for building secondary indexes

## More patterns

For comprehensive architecture patterns covering real-time applications, AI, analytics, and more, see:

- [Patterns for building real-time applications]({{< relref "/develop/patterns" >}}) - Practical guides for:
  - Real-time ingestion and transformation with Streams
  - JSON document queries and vector similarity search
  - Real-time analytics and aggregations
  - Messaging and coordination patterns
  - Data modeling best practices
  - AI and agentic patterns (RAG, semantic caching, multi-agent systems)
