description: Connect your Lettuce application to a Redis database
linkTitle: Lettuce (Java)

[Lettuce](https://github.com/redis/lettuce/tree/main/src/main) is an advanced Java client for Redis
that supports synchronous, asynchronous, and reactive connections.
If you only need synchronous connections then you may find the other Java client
[Jedis]({{< relref "/develop/clients/jedis" >}}) easier to use.

The sections below explain how to install `Lettuce` and connect your application
to a Redis database.

`Lettuce` requires a running Redis or [Redis Stack]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/" >}}) server. See [Getting started]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/" >}}) for Redis installation instructions.

## Install

To include Lettuce as a dependency in your application, edit the appropriate dependency file as shown below.

If you use Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.lettuce</groupId>
    <artifactId>lettuce-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.3.2.RELEASE</version> <!-- Check for the latest version on Maven Central -->
</dependency>
```

If you use Gradle, include this line in your `build.gradle` file:

```
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'io.lettuce:lettuce-core:6.3.2.RELEASE'
}
```

If you wish to use the JAR files directly, download the latest Lettuce and, optionally, Apache Commons Pool2 JAR files from Maven Central or any other Maven repository.

To build from source, see the instructions on the [Lettuce source code GitHub repo](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core).

## Connect and test

Connect to a local server using the following code. This example
also stores and retrieves a simple string value to test the connection.

```java
import io.lettuce.core.*;
import io.lettuce.core.api.StatefulRedisConnection;
import io.lettuce.core.api.sync.RedisCommands;

public class ConnectBasicTest {

    public void connectBasic() {
        RedisURI uri = RedisURI.Builder
                .redis("localhost", 6379)
                .build();

        RedisClient client = RedisClient.create(uri);
        StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> connection = client.connect();
        RedisCommands<String, String> commands = connection.sync();

        commands.set("foo", "bar");
        String result = commands.get("foo");
        System.out.println(result); // >>> bar

        connection.close();

        client.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## More information

The [Lettuce reference guide](https://redis.github.io/lettuce/) has more examples
and an API reference. You may also be interested in the
[Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) library that Lettuce uses.
