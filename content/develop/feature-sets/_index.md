A Redis feature set represents the complete set of features available in a specific Redis version.

The following Redis feature sets are supported and maintained:

- Redis feature set [7.4]({{< relref "/develop/feature-sets/7-4" >}})
- Redis feature set 7.2
- Redis feature set 6.2

To use a new feature introduced in a later feature set, you must upgrade the corresponding components included in that feature set.
