You have two choices of Python clients that you can use with Redis:

-   [Redis Python library (redis-py)]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/python/redis-py" >}})
-   [Redis vector library (RedisVL)]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/python/redis-vl" >}})

You can also access Redis with an object-mapping client interface. See
[RedisOM for Python]({{< relref "/integrate/redisom-for-python" >}})
for more information.
