You have two choices of Java clients that you can use with Redis:

-   [Jedis]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/java/jedis" >}}), for synchronous applications.
-   [Lettuce]({{< relref "/develop/connect/clients/java/lettuce" >}}),
    for asynchronous and reactive applications.

You can also access Redis with an object-mapping client interface. See
[RedisOM for Java]({{< relref "/integrate/redisom-for-java" >}})
for more information.
