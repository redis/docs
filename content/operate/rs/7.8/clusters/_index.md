You can manage your Redis Enterprise Software clusters with several different tools:

- Cluster Manager UI (the web-based user interface)
- Command-line tools ([rladmin]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin" >}}), [redis-cli]({{< relref "/develop/tools/cli" >}}), [crdb-cli]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli" >}}))
- [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/_index.md" >}})
