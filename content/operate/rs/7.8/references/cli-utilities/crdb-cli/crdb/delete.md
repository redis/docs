Deletes an Active-Active database.

```sh
crdb-cli crdb delete --crdb-guid <guid>
         [ --no-wait ]
```

This command is irreversible. If the data in your database is important, back it up before you delete the database.

### Parameters

| Parameter           | Value  | Description                         |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| crdb-guid | string | The GUID of the database (required) |
| no-wait             |        | Does not wait for the task to complete |

### Returns

Returns the task ID of the task that is deleting the database.

If `--no-wait` is specified, the command exits. Otherwise, it will wait for the database to be deleted and return `finished`.

### Example

```sh
$ crdb-cli crdb delete --crdb-guid db6365b5-8aca-4055-95d8-7eb0105c0b35
Task dfe6cacc-88ff-4667-812e-938fd05fe359 created
  ---> Status changed: queued -> started
