This is the basic version of the update request. See [Update database and perform action](#put-bdbs-action) to send an update request with an additional action.

To track this request's progress, poll the [`/actions/<action_uid>` endpoint]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/actions" >}}) with the action_uid returned in the response body.

## Create database v1 {#post-bdbs-v1}

```sh
POST /v1/bdbs
```
Create a new database in the cluster.

The request must contain a single JSON [BDB object]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/objects/bdb" >}}) with the configuration parameters for the new database.

The following parameters are required to create the database:

| Parameter | Type/Value | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| name     | string     | Name of the new database |
| memory_size | integer | Size of the database, in bytes |

If passed with the `dry_run` URL query string, the function will validate the [BDB object]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/objects/bdb" >}}), but will not invoke the state machine that will create it.

To track this request's progress, poll the [`/actions/<action_uid>` endpoint]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/actions" >}}) with the `action_uid` returned in the response body.

The cluster will use default configuration for any missing database field. The cluster creates a database UID if it is missing.

| dry_run |    | Validate the new [BDB object]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/objects/bdb" >}}) but don't create the database. |

#### Body

Include a [BDB object]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/objects/bdb" >}}) in the request body.

| Paramter | Type/Value | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| name     | string     | Name of the new database |
| memory_size | integer | Size of the database, in bytes |

The `uid` of the database is auto-assigned by the cluster because it was not explicitly listed in this request. If you specify the database ID (`uid`), then you must specify the database ID for every subsequent database and make sure that the database ID does not conflict with an existing database. If you do not specify the database ID, then the it is automatically assigned in sequential order.

Defaults are used for all other configuration parameters.

#### Example JSON body

```json
{
    "name": "test-database",
    "type": "redis",
    "memory_size": 1073741824

## Create database v2 {#post-bdbs-v2}

```sh
POST /v2/bdbs
```
Create a new database in the cluster. See [`POST /v1/bdbs`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.8/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs#post-bdbs-v1" >}}) for more information.

The database's configuration should be under the "bdb" field.

This endpoint allows you to specify a recovery_plan to recover a database. If you include a recovery_plan within the request body, the database will be loaded from the persistence files according to the recovery plan. The recovery plan must match the number of shards requested for the database.

The persistence files must exist in the locations specified by the recovery plan. The persistence files must belong to a database with the same shard settings as the one being created (slot range distribution and shard_key_regex); otherwise, the operation will fail or yield unpredictable results.

If you create a database with a shards_blueprint and a recovery plan, the shard placement may not fully follow the shards_blueprint.
