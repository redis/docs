The Redis Enterprise Software product lifecycle fully reflects the [subscription agreement](https://redis.com/software-subscription-agreement).
However, for any discrepancy between the two policies, the subscription agreement prevails.

Redis Enterprise modules follow the [modules lifecycle]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/modules-lifecycle" >}}).

## Release numbers

Redis uses a four-place numbering scheme to designate released versions of its products.
The format is “Major1.Major2.Minor-Build”.

- Major sections of the version number represents fundamental changes and additions in
    capabilities to Redis  Enterprise Software. The Major1 and Major2 part of the
    version number are incremented based on the size and scale of the changes in each
    release.
- The Minor section of the version number represents quality improvements, fixes to
    existing capabilities, and new capabilities which are typically minor, feature-flagged, or optional. 
- Build number is incremented with any changes to the product. Build number is
    incremented with each build when any change is made to the binaries.

Redis Enterprise Software typically gets two major releases every year but the product shipping cycles may vary.
Maintenance releases, typically available on the last minor release of the current major1.major2 release are typically made available on a monthly cadence, although cycles may vary.

## End-of-life schedule {#endoflife-schedule}

For Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2 and later, the end-of-life (EOL) for each major release occurs 24 months after the formal release of the subsequent major version. Monthly maintenance will be provided on the last minor release of the major1.major2 releases.
This update to the EOL policy allows a lead time of at least 24 months to upgrade to the new release after it is available.
