By default, Redis Enterprise Software is installed with the user:group `redislabs:redislabs`.

During installation, you can specify the user and group that own all Redis Enterprise Software processes.

## Considerations

- Custom installation user is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

- You must create the user and group before installing Redis Enterprise Software.

- You must install Redis Enterprise Software on all nodes in the cluster with the same user and group.

- You can specify an LDAP user as the installation user.

- If you specify the user only, then installation is run with the primary group that the user belongs to.

## Install with custom user or group

To customize the user or group during [installation]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/install-on-linux" >}}), include the `--os-user` or `--os-group` [command-line options]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/install-script" >}}) when you run the `install.sh` script.

```sh
sudo ./install.sh --os-user <user> --os-group <group>
```
