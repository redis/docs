After you [plan your deployment]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/plan-deployment" >}}), [download a Redis Enterprise Software installation package]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/prepare-install/download-install-package" >}}), and finish [installation preparation]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/prepare-install" >}}):

1. [Install the Redis Enterprise Software package]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/install-on-linux" >}}) on one of the nodes in the cluster.

1. Repeat this process for each node in the cluster.

For installation on machines without an internet connection, see [Offline installation]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/install/offline-installation" >}}).

## Permissions and access

- Redis Enterprise Software installation creates the `redislabs:redislabs` user and group. 

    Assigning other users to the `redislabs` group is optional. Users belonging to the `redislabs` group have permission to read and execute (e.g. use the `rladmin` status command) but are not allowed to write (or delete) files or directories.

- Redis Enterprise Software is certified to run with permissions set to `750`, an industry standard.

    {{<warning>}}
Do not reduce permissions to `700`. This configuration has not been tested and is not supported.
    {{</warning>}}

- [Upgrade an existing deployment]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading" >}}).

## Next steps

After your cluster is set up with nodes, you can:

- [Add users]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/create-users" >}}) to the cluster with specific permissions.  To begin, start with [Access control]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control" >}}).
- [Create databases]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/create" >}}) to use with your applications.
