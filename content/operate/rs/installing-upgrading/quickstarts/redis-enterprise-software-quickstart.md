linkTitle: Quickstart
title: Redis Enterprise Software quickstart
weight: 1
---
This guide helps you install Redis Enterprise Software on a Linux host to test its capabilities.

When finished, you'll have a simple cluster with a single node:

1. [Ensure port availability](#ensure-port-availability)

1. [Install Redis Enterprise Software](#install-redis-enterprise-software)

1. [Set up a Redis Enterprise Software cluster](#set-up-a-cluster)

1. [Create a new Redis database](#create-a-database)

1. [Connect to your Redis database](#connect-to-your-database)

{{< note >}}
**This quickstart is designed for local testing only.**
For production environments, see the [install and setup]({{< relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading#install-redis-enterprise-software" >}}) guide for deployment options and instructions.

## Ensure port availability

{{<embed-md "port-availability-embed.md">}}

### Update `sysctl.conf` to avoid port collisions

{{<embed-md "port-collision-avoidance.md">}}

### Ubuntu conflicts with port 53

{{<embed-md "port-53.md">}}


### Configuration for AWS and GCP

For detailed configuration instructions, see your cloud provider's documentation.

1. Create a VPC that you can use with regional subnets.

1. Within this VPC, create firewall rules that allow external and internal access for Redis Enterprise Software.

## Install Redis Enterprise Software

To install Redis Enterprise Software:

1. Download the installation files from the [Redis Enterprise Download Center](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/download-center/software/)
and copy the download package to a machine with a Linux-based OS. 

    {{< note >}}
You are required to create a free account to access the download center.
    {{< /note >}}

1. Extract the installation files:

    ```sh
    tar vxf <downloaded tar file name>
    ```

1. Run the `install.sh` script in the current directory:

    ```sh
    sudo ./install.sh -y
    ```

## Set up a cluster

To set up your machine as a Redis Enterprise Software cluster:

{{< embed-md "cluster-setup.md" >}}

## Create a database

{{<embed-md "quick-db-setup.md">}}

## Connect to your database

After you create the Redis database, you can connect to it and store data.
See [Test client connection]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/connect/test-client-connectivity" >}}) for connection options and examples.

## Supported web browsers

To use the Redis Enterprise Software Cluster Manager UI, you need a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
 
The Cluster Manager UI is officially supported for the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), as well as the three previous and three subsequent versions.
