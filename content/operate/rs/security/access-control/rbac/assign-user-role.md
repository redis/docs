Assign a role, associated with specific databases and access control lists (ACLs), to a user to grant database access:

1. From the **Access Control > Users** tab in the Cluster Manager UI, you can:

    - Point to an existing user and select {{< image filename="/images/rs/buttons/edit-button.png#no-click" alt="The Edit button" width="25px" class="inline" >}} to edit the user.
    
    - Select **+ Add user** to [create a new user]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-users/add-users" >}}).

1. Select a role to assign to the user.

1. Select **Save**.

## Next steps

Depending on the type of the user's assigned role (cluster management role or data access role), the user can now:

- [Connect to a database]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/connect" >}}) associated with the role and run limited Redis commands, depending on the role's Redis ACLs.

- Sign in to the Redis Enterprise Software Cluster Manager UI.

- Make a [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api" >}}) request.
