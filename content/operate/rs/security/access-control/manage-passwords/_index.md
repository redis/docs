Redis Enterprise Software provides several ways to manage the passwords of local accounts, including:

- [Password complexity rules]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-passwords/password-complexity-rules" >}})

- [Password expiration]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-passwords/password-expiration" >}})

- [Password rotation]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-passwords/rotate-passwords" >}})

You can also manage a user's ability to [sign in]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-users/login-lockout#user-login-lockout" >}}) and control [session timeout]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-users/login-lockout#session-timeout" >}}).

To enforce more advanced password policies, we recommend using [LDAP integration]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/ldap" >}}) with an external identity provider, such as Active Directory.

{{<note>}}
Redis Enterprise Software securely stores all user passwords using a cryptographic hash function. The default password hashing algorithm is `SHA-256`, but you can [change the password hashing algorithm]({{<relref "/operate/rs/security/access-control/manage-passwords/password-hashing-algorithm">}}) to `PBKDF2` as of Redis Enterprise Software version 7.8.6-13.
