| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [GET](#get-all-actions) | `/v1/actions` | Get all actions |
| [GET](#get-all-actions-v2) | `/v2/actions` | Get all actions |
| [GET](#get-action) | `/v1/actions/{uid}` | Get a single action |
| [GET](#get-action-v2) | `/v2/actions/{uid}` | Get a single action |

## Get all actions v1 {#get-all-actions}

```
GET /v1/actions
```

Get the status of all running, pending, or completed actions on all clusters, nodes, and databases. This API tracks long-lived API requests that return either a `task_id` or an `action_uid`.

This API does not return any information about other actions, such as import, export, and backup. To get info about these actions, use [`GET /v2/actions`](#get-all-actions-v2).

#### Required permissions

| Permission name |

| [view_status_of_cluster_action]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/permissions#view_status_of_cluster_action" >}}) |

### Request {#get-all-request}

#### Example HTTP request

```
GET /v1/actions
```

### Response {#get-all-response}

Returns a JSON array of [action objects]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/objects/action" >}}), which represent tasks, and an array of [state-machine objects]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/objects/state-machine" >}}).

| Field | Type/Value | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| action_uid | string | The action's globally unique identifier |
| name | string | Name of the running or failed state machine |
| progress | float (range: 0-100) | Percent of completed steps for the action |
| status | "pending"<br />"active"<br />"completed"<br />"failed" | The action's status |
| node_uid | string | UID of the node where the operation runs (optional) |
| object_name | string | The object that the action runs on (optional) |
| state | string | The current state of the state machine (optional)  |
| pending_ops | JSON object | List of operations that are waiting to run (optional)<br />{{<code>}}"pending_ops": {<br />  "3": {<br />    "heartbeat": integer,<br />    "snapshot": { ... },<br />    "last_sample_time": integer,<br />    "op_name": string,<br />    "status_code": string,<br />    "status_description": string,<br />    "progress": float<br />  }<br />}{{</code>}}<br />`pending_ops` is a map where the key is the `shard_id`, and the value is a map that can include the following optional fields:<br />**heartbeat**: The time, in seconds since the Unix epoch, since the last change in the progress of the operation.<br />**snapshot**: A map of properties stored by the operation that are needed to run.<br />**last_sample_time**: The time, in seconds since the Unix epoch, when the last snapshot of the operation was taken.<br />**op_name**: The name of the operation from the state machine that is running.<br />**status_code**: The code for the operation's current status.<br />**status_description**: The operation's current status.<br />**progress**: The operation's progress in percentage (1 to 100). |

Regardless of an action’s source, each action in the response contains the following attributes: `name`, `action_uid`, `status`, and `progress`.
