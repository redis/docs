You can use the Redis Cluster API along with other Redis Enterprise Software high availability
to get high performance with low latency
and let applications stay current with cluster topology changes, including add node, remove node, and node failover.

For more about working with the Redis Cluster API in Redis Enterprise Software, see [Enable Redis Cluster API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/configure/oss-cluster-api" >}}). 

To learn how to enable Redis Cluster API in Redis Cloud, see [Clustering Redis databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/clustering#cluster-api" >}}).
