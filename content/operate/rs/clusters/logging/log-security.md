Redis Enterprise comes with [a set of logs]({{< relref "/operate/rs/clusters/logging" >}}) on the server and available through the user interface to assist users in investigating actions taken on the server and to troubleshoot issues.

## Send logs to a remote logging server

Redis Enterprise sends logs to syslog by default. You can send these logs to a remote logging server by configuring syslog.

To do this, modify the syslog or rsyslog configuration on your operating system to send logs in the `$logdir` directory (`/var/opt/redislabs/log` in default installations) to a remote monitoring server of your choice. See [rsyslog logging]({{< relref "/operate/rs/clusters/logging/rsyslog-logging/" >}}) for additional details.

## Log rotation

Redis Enterprise Software's job scheduler runs `logrotate` every five minutes to examine logs stored on the operating system and rotate them based on the log rotation configuration. You can find the log rotation configuration file at `$pkgconfdir/logrotate.conf` as of Redis Enterprise Software version 7.2 (`pkgconfdir` is `/opt/redislabs/config` by default, but can be changed in a custom installation).

By default, log rotation occurs when a log exceeds 200 MB. We recommend sending log files to a remote logging server so you can maintain them more effectively.

The following log rotation policy is enabled by default in Redis Enterprise Software, but you can modify it as needed.

```sh
${logdir}/*.log {
    su ${osuser} ${osgroup}
    maxsize 200M
    daily
    missingok
    copytruncate
    rotate 10
    maxage 7
    compress
    notifempty
    nodateext
    nosharedscripts
    prerotate
        # copy cluster_wd log to another file that will have longer retention
        if [ "\$1" = "${logdir}/cluster_wd.log" ]; then
            cp -p ${logdir}/cluster_wd.log ${logdir}/cluster_wd.log.long_retention
        fi
    endscript
}
${logdir}/cluster_wd.log.long_retention {
    su ${osuser} ${osgroup}
    daily
    missingok
    copytruncate
    rotate 30
    compress
    notifempty
    nodateext
}
```

- `${logdir}/*.log`: `logrotate` checks the files under the `$logdir` directory (`/var/opt/redislabs/log/`) and rotates any files that end with the extension `.log`.

- `${logdir}/cluster_wd.log.long_retention`: `cluster_wd.log` is copied to `cluster_wd.log.long_retention` before rotation. This copy is kept longer than usual, which is 30 days by default.

- `maxsize 200M`: Rotate log files that exceed 200 MB.

- `daily`: Rotate logs every day regardless of their size.

- `missingok`: If there are missing log files, do nothing.

- `copytruncate`: Truncate the original log file to zero sizes after creating a copy.

- `rotate 10`: Save a maximum of 10 rotated log files. To keep effectively infinite log files, use `rotate 2000` instead.

- `compress`: gzip log files.

- `maxage 7`: Keep the rotated log files for 7 days.

- `notifempty`: Don't rotate the log file if it is empty.

{{<note>}}
For large scale deployments, you might need to rotate logs at faster intervals than daily. You can also use a cronjob or external vendor solutions.
