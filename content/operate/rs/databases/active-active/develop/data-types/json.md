Active-Active databases support JSON data structures.

The design is based on [A Conflict-Free Replicated JSON Datatype](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960) by Kleppmann and Beresford, but the implementation includes some changes. Several [conflict resolution rule](#conflict-resolution-rules) examples were adapted from this paper as well.

## Prerequisites

To use JSON in an Active-Active database, you must enable JSON during database creation.

Active-Active Redis Cloud databases add JSON by default. See [Create an Active-Active subscription]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-active-active-database#select-capabilities" >}}) in the Redis Cloud documentation for details.

In Redis Enterprise Software, JSON is not enabled by default for Active-Active databases. See [Create an Active-Active JSON database]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/json/active-active#create-an-active-active-json-database" >}}) in the Redis Stack and Redis Enterprise documentation for instructions.
