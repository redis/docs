---

The new metrics stream engine is generally available as of [Redis Enterprise Software version 8.0]({{<relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-8-0-releases">}}).

The new metrics stream engine:

- Exposes the v2 Prometheus scraping endpoint at `https://<IP>:8070/v2`.

- Exports all time-series metrics to external monitoring tools such as Grafana, DataDog, NewRelic, and Dynatrace using Prometheus.

- Enables real-time monitoring, including full monitoring during maintenance operations, which provides full visibility into performance during events such as shards' failovers and scaling operations.

## Integrate with external monitoring tools

To integrate Redis Enterprise metrics into your monitoring environment, see the integration guides for [Prometheus and Grafana]({{< relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/prometheus_and_grafana" >}}).

Filter [Libraries and tools]({{<relref "/integrate">}}) by "observability" for additional tools and guides.

## Prometheus metrics v2

For a list of all available v2 metrics, see [Prometheus metrics v2]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/metrics/prometheus-metrics-v2">}}).

The v2 scraping endpoint also exposes metrics for `node_exporter` version 1.8.1. For more information, see the [Prometheus node_exporter GitHub repository](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter).

## Transition from Prometheus v1 to Prometheus v2

If you are already using the existing scraping endpoint for integration, do the following to transition from v1 metrics to v2 metrics:

1. Change the `metrics_path` in your Prometheus configuration file from `/` to `/v2` to use the new scraping endpoint.

    Here's an example of the updated scraping configuration in `prometheus.yml`:

    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      # Scrape Redis Enterprise
      - job_name: redis-enterprise
        scrape_interval: 30s
        scrape_timeout: 30s
        metrics_path: /v2
        scheme: https
        tls_config:
          insecure_skip_verify: true
        static_configs:
          - targets: ["<cluster_name>:8070"]
    ```

1. Use the metrics tables in [this guide]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/metrics/prometheus-metrics-v1-to-v2">}}) to transition from v1 metrics to equivalent v2 PromQL.

It is possible to scrape both existing and new endpoints simultaneously, allowing advanced dashboard preparation and a smooth transition.

## Best practices for monitoring

Follow these best practices when monitoring your Redis Enterprise Software cluster using the metrics stream engine.

### Monitor host-level metrics

For cluster health, resources, and node stability, monitor these metrics:

| Group | Metric | Why monitor | Unit |
|-------|--------|-------------|------|
| CPU utilization | `node_cpu_user`,<br />`node_cpu_system` | Detect CPU saturation from Redis or the OS that results in higher latency and queueing. | Seconds (counter) |
| Memory (freeable) | <span class="break-all">`node_memory_MemTotal_bytes`</span>,<br /><span class="break-all">`node_memory_MemFree_bytes`</span>,<br /><span class="break-all">`node_memory_Buffers_bytes`</span>,<br /><span class="break-all">`node_memory_Cached_bytes`</span> | Detect memory pressure early. Low free memory or cache can precede swapping or out-of-memory errors. | Bytes (gauge) |
| Swap usage | <span class="break-all">`node_ephemeral_storage_free`</span> | Monitor memory and disk pressure in your setup. Sustained pressure leads to latency spikes. | Bytes (gauge) |
| Network traffic | <span class="break-all">`node_ingress_bytes`</span>,<br /><span class="break-all">`node_egress_bytes`</span> | Ensure the network interface is not saturated. Protects replication and client responsiveness. | Bytes (counter) |

| Cluster state | `has_quorum{…}` | Monitor whether quorum is maintained (1) or lost (0). | Boolean |
