​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 7.22.0](https://redis.io/downloads/#software) is now available!

## Highlights

This version offers:

- `license_expiration_days` metric for monitoring

- Bug fixes for user password management REST API requests, cluster setup in the Cluster Manager UI, cluster upgrades, maintenance mode snapshot cleanup, database availability API performance, Active-Active syncing, and more

## New in this release

### Enhancements

- Added the `license_expiration_days` metric to the [metrics stream engine]({{<relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/metrics_stream_engine">}}). This metric tracks the number of days until the [cluster license expires]({{<relref "/operate/rs/clusters/configure/license-keys#expired-cluster-license">}}).

### Redis database versions

Redis Enterprise Software version 7.22.0 includes three Redis database versions: 7.4, 7.2, and 6.2.

The [default Redis database version]({{<relref "/operate/rs/databases/configure/db-defaults#database-version">}}) is 7.4.

### Redis module feature sets

Redis Enterprise Software comes packaged with several modules. As of version 7.22.0, Redis Enterprise Software includes three feature sets, compatible with different Redis database versions.

The following table shows which Redis modules are compatible with each Redis database version included in this release.

## Known issues

- RS131972: Creating an ACL that contains a line break in the Cluster Manager UI can cause shard migration to fail due to ACL errors.

- RS155734: Endpoint availability metrics do not work as expected due to a calculation error.

- RS156391: The `job_scheduler`'s memory usage can increase significantly when the diagnostic logging service is enabled.

- RS153589: The metrics stream engine preview reports incorrect latency metrics.

## Known limitations

#### Upload modules before OS upgrade

If the cluster contains any databases that use modules, you must upload module packages for the target OS version to a node in the existing cluster before you upgrade the cluster's operating system.

See [Upgrade a cluster's operating system]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/upgrade-os">}}) for detailed upgrade instructions.

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance" >}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.

#### RedisGraph prevents upgrade to RHEL 9

You cannot upgrade from a prior RHEL version to RHEL 9 if the Redis Enterprise Software cluster contains a RedisGraph module, even if unused by any database. The [RedisGraph module has reached End-of-Life](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/) and is completely unavailable in RHEL 9.

#### Query results might include hash keys with lazily expired fields

If one or more fields of a hash key expire after an `FT.SEARCH` or `FT.AGGREGATE` query begins, Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields might still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.

#### Active defragmentation does not stop mid-key for JSON

Active defragmentation does not stop mid-key for JSON data. Large keys are defragmented in full, which might cause latency spikes.

## Security

#### Open source Redis security fixes compatibility

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Enterprise Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with [open source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis Enterprise Software has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs.

Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Enterprise Software due to different or additional functionality available in Redis Enterprise Software that is not available in open source Redis.

Redis Enterprise Software 7.22.0-216 supports open source Redis 7.4, 7.2, and 6.2. Below is the list of open source Redis CVEs fixed by version.

Redis 7.4.x:

- (CVE-2025-21605) An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers until the server runs out of memory or is terminated, which can lead to denial-of-service.

Redis 7.2.x:

- (CVE-2025-21605) An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers until the server runs out of memory or is terminated, which can lead to denial-of-service.

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.2.1)

Redis 7.0.x:

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.0.13)

- (CVE-2023-36824) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption, and potentially remote code execution. Specifically: using `COMMAND GETKEYS*` and validation of key names in ACL rules. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 7.0.11)

- (CVE-2023-28425) Specially crafted `MSETNX` commands can lead to assertion and denial-of-service. (Redis 7.0.10)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 7.0.8)

- (CVE-2022-35951) Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument, may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.5)

- (CVE-2022-31144) A specially crafted `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state may result in heap overflow and potentially remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.4)

- (CVE-2022-24834) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result in a crash of the `redis-server` process. This issue affects all versions of Redis. (Redis 7.0.0)

- (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. (Redis 7.0.0)
