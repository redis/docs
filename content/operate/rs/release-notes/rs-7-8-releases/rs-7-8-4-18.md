​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 7.8.4](https://redis.io/downloads/#software) is now available! This release includes API enhancements that warranted a new minor version instead of a maintenance release for version 7.8.2. However, you can upgrade from 7.8.2 to 7.8.4 without issue.

## Highlights

This version offers:

- Certificate-based authentication for the REST API

- Dry run option to validate Redis ACL REST API requests

## New in this release

### New features

- Certificate-based authentication for the REST API

    - Added support for certificate-based authentication to enable secure, passwordless access to the Redis Software REST API.

    - Certificate-based authentication can be used in addition to basic authentication with a username and password.

    - To set up certificate-based authentication, use [REST API]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api">}}) requests to do the following:

        1. Configure a trusted CA certificate `mtls_trusted_ca` using an [update cluster certificate]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster/certificates#put-cluster-update_cert">}}) request:

            ```sh
            PUT /v1/cluster/update_cert
            {
              "name": "mtls_trusted_ca",
              "certificate": "<content of certificate PEM file>"
            }
            ```

        1. [Update cluster settings]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster#put-cluster">}}) with mutual TLS configuration:

            ```sh
            PUT /v1/cluster
            {
              "mtls_certificate_authentication": true,
              "mtls_client_cert_subject_validation_type": "san_cn",
              "mtls_authorized_subjects": [{
                "CN": "test",
                "OU": [],
                "O": "",
                "C": "",
                "L": "",
                "ST": ""
              }]
            }
            ```

        1. Include `"auth_method": "certificate"` and `certificate_subject_line` in the request body when you [create new users]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/users#post-user">}}) or [update existing users]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/users#put-user">}}):

            ```sh
            POST /v1/users | PUT /v1/users/<user-id>
            {
              "auth_method": "certificate",
              "certificate_subject_line": "<subject of the user's client certificate>"
            }
            ```

    - Limitations: 

        - Certificate-based authentication is not implemented for the Cluster Manager UI.

### Enhancements

- If you create or update a Redis ACL using the REST API, you can use the `dry_run` query parameter to validate the request without actually applying the update.

    - [Create Redis ACL]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/redis_acls#post-redis_acl">}}) example request:

        ```sh
        POST /v1/redis_acls?dry_run
        ```

    - [Update Redis ACL]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/redis_acls#put-redis_acl">}}) example request: 

        ```sh
        PUT /v1/redis_acls/<uid>?dry_run
        ```

### Redis database versions

Redis Software version 7.8.4 includes three Redis database versions: 7.4, 7.2, and 6.2.

The [default Redis database version]({{<relref "/operate/rs/databases/configure/db-defaults#database-version">}}) is 7.4.

### Redis module feature sets

Redis Software comes packaged with several modules. As of version 7.8.2, Redis Software includes three feature sets, compatible with different Redis database versions.

The following table shows which Redis modules are compatible with each Redis database version included in this release.

## Known issues

- RS131972: Creating an ACL that contains a line break in the Cluster Manager UI can cause shard migration to fail due to ACL errors.

- RS151990: For RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 clusters, importing an RDB file can fail with the exception: `Failed to import rdb file: general-error`.

    As a workaround:

    1. On each cluster node, run:

        ```sh
        sudo dnf install boost-program-options
        ```

    1. Verify that `libboost_program_options.so.1.75.0` points to a path to confirm the installation succeeded:

        ```sh
        ldd /opt/redislabs/bin/rl_rdbloader
        ```

## Known limitations

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance" >}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.

#### RedisGraph prevents upgrade to RHEL 9 

You cannot upgrade from a prior RHEL version to RHEL 9 if the Redis Software cluster contains a RedisGraph module, even if unused by any database. The [RedisGraph module has reached End-of-Life](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/) and is completely unavailable in RHEL 9.

#### Query results might include hash keys with lazily expired fields

If one or more fields of a hash key expire after an `FT.SEARCH` or `FT.AGGREGATE` query begins, Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields might still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.

## Security

#### Open source Redis security fixes compatibility

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with [open source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis Software has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs.

Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Software due to different or additional functionality available in Redis Software that is not available in open source Redis.

Redis Software 7.8.4-18 supports open source Redis 7.4, 7.2, and 6.2. Below is the list of open source Redis CVEs fixed by version.

Redis 7.2.x:

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.2.1)

Redis 7.0.x:

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.0.13)

- (CVE-2023-36824) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption, and potentially remote code execution. Specifically: using `COMMAND GETKEYS*` and validation of key names in ACL rules. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 7.0.11)

- (CVE-2023-28425) Specially crafted `MSETNX` commands can lead to assertion and denial-of-service. (Redis 7.0.10)

- (CVE-2023-22458) Integer overflow in the Redis `HRANDFIELD` and `ZRANDMEMBER` commands can lead to denial-of-service. (Redis 7.0.8)

- (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis can cause it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. (Redis 7.0.9)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 7.0.8)

- (CVE-2022-35951) Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument, may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.5)

- (CVE-2022-31144) A specially crafted `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state may result in heap overflow and potentially remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.4)

- (CVE-2022-24834) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2022-24736) An attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result in a crash of the `redis-server` process. This issue affects all versions of Redis. (Redis 7.0.0)

- (CVE-2022-24735) By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. (Redis 7.0.0)

Redis 6.2.x:

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 6.2.12)

- (CVE-2023-25155) Specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. (Redis 6.2.11)

- (CVE-2023-22458) Integer overflow in the Redis `HRANDFIELD` and `ZRANDMEMBER` commands can lead to denial-of-service. (Redis 6.2.9)

- (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis can cause it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. (Redis 6.2.11)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 6.2.9)

- (CVE-2022-24834) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. (Redis 6.2.13)

- (CVE-2021-32762) Integer to heap buffer overflow issue in `redis-cli` and `redis-sentinel` parsing large multi-bulk replies on some older and less common platforms. (Redis 6.2.6)

- (CVE-2021-32761) An integer overflow bug in Redis version 2.2 or newer can be exploited using the `BITFIELD` command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. (Redis 6.2.5)

- (CVE-2021-32687) Integer to heap buffer overflow with intsets, when `set-max-intset-entries` is manually configured to a non-default, very large value. (Redis 6.2.6)

- (CVE-2021-32675) Denial Of Service when processing RESP request payloads with a large number of elements on many connections. (Redis 6.2.6)

- (CVE-2021-32672) Random heap reading issue with Lua Debugger. (Redis 6.2.6)

- (CVE-2021-32628) Integer to heap buffer overflow handling ziplist-encoded data types, when configuring a large, non-default value for `hash-max-ziplist-entries`, `hash-max-ziplist-value`, `zset-max-ziplist-entries` or `zset-max-ziplist-value`. (Redis 6.2.6)

- (CVE-2021-32625) An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer can be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. (Redis 6.2.4)

- (CVE-2021-29478) An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration value, creating a large set key that consists of integer values and using the COPY command to duplicate it. The integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with 2.6, where it could result with a corrupted RDB or DUMP payload, but not exploited through COPY (which did not exist before 6.2). (Redis 6.2.3)

- (CVE-2021-29477) An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result in remote code execution. The integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with 6.0. (Redis 6.2.3)
