​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 8.0.0](https://redis.io/downloads/#software) is now available!

## Highlights

This version offers:

- TBA

## New in this release

### New features

- TBA

### Enhancements

- Added `--update-db-config-modules` option to the [`crdb-cli crdb update`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/update">}}) command to streamline updating module information in the CRDB configuration after uprading modules used by Active-Active databases. Use this option only after all CRDB database instances have upgraded their modules.

    ```sh
    crdb-cli crdb update --crdb-guid <guid> --update-db-config-modules true
    ```

### Redis database versions

Redis Software version 8.0.0 includes three Redis database versions: 8.2, 7.4, 7.2.

The [default Redis database version]({{<relref "/operate/rs/databases/configure/db-defaults#database-version">}}) is 7.4.

### Redis module feature sets

Redis Software comes packaged with several modules. As of version 7.8.2, Redis Software includes three feature sets, compatible with different Redis database versions.

The following table shows which Redis modules are compatible with each Redis database version included in this release.

### Resolved issues

- RS156391: Fixed an issue where the `job_scheduler`'s memory usage could increase significantly when the diagnostic logging service was enabled.

- RS132033: Fixed an issue where out-of-memory errors in the Lua interpreter prevented scripts from running Redis commands until the shard was restarted. This fix is included in Redis database version 7.2 and requires a database upgrade from earlier versions.

- RS153192: Updated the installer's minimum RAM requirement to 8 GB.

- RS159685: Fixed an issue with high DMC CPU usage after changing the primary node of a cluster that has Active-Active databases.

- RS160546: Fixed an issue where `rladmin status extra all` did not show available RAM.

- RS150592: Fixed an issue where connection errors were not automatically retried.

- RS161945: Fixed an issue where state machine logs showed a generic state machine ID instead of the descriptive state machine name when creating a database from persistence.

- RS160196: Fixed an issue where a node could be set as primary before completing the bootstrap process.

- RS153736: Fixed an issue where the `PUBSUB SHARDNUMSUB` command would not respond when called without arguments if the OSS Cluster API was enabled.

- RS163254: Fixed an issue where the policy update logs displayed inconsistent boolean value formats, mixing `enabled/disabled` and `True/False`.

- RS158250: Fixed an issue with Active-Active databases with search enabled where replica shards could crash after migration to a new node.

- RS164471: Fixed an issue where the script to generate self-signed certificate (generate_self_signed_certs.sh) failed on custom installations due to hard-coded file paths.

- RS164218: Fixed an issue where Speedb log files were not properly rotated and archived, causing logs to accumulate and consume disk space.

- RS162719: Fixed an issue where connection problems could prevent shards from restarting during failover and cause the failover process to become stuck.

- RS161589: Changed the installer answers file parameter from `skip_updating_env_path` to `update_env_path` to improve clarity and accuracy.

- RS161574: Fixed an issue where Active-Active database synchronization could fail when Lua scripts used certain read-only commands that accessed keys across multiple slots.

- RS160347: Made optimizations to reduce the `heartbeatd` service's memory usage.

- RS156394: Improved error messages when module commands are temporarily unavailable during cluster configuration changes.

- RS154815: Improved diagnostic reporting for connection issues when the maximum number of transactions is reached.

- RS147053: Fixed an issue where some `system_reserved_ports` were not displayed in the `rladmin info cluster` command output.

- RS114668: Fixed an issue where setting `failure_detection_sensitivity` with the `bootstrap` API did not automatically update `watchdog_profile` accordingly.

## Version changes

- TBA

### Breaking changes

Redis Software version 8.0.x introduces the following breaking changes:

- TBA

### Product lifecycle updates

- TBA

### Deprecations

#### API deprecations

- TBA

#### Internal monitoring and v1 Prometheus metrics deprecation

The existing [internal monitoring engine]({{<relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/v1_monitoring">}}) is deprecated. We recommend transitioning to the new [metrics stream engine]({{<relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/metrics_stream_engine">}}) for improved performance, enhanced integration capabilities, and modernized metrics streaming.

V1 Prometheus metrics are deprecated but still available. To transition to the new metrics stream engine, either migrate your existing dashboards using [this guide]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/metrics/prometheus-metrics-v1-to-v2">}}) now, or wait to use new preconfigured dashboards when they become available in a future release.

### Upcoming changes

## Security

#### Open source Redis security fixes compatibility

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with [open source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis Software has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs.

Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Software due to different or additional functionality available in Redis Software that is not available in open source Redis.

Redis Software 8.0.x-tba supports open source Redis 7.4, 7.2, and 6.2. Below is the list of open source Redis CVEs fixed by version.

Redis 7.4.x:

- (CVE-2025-32023) An authenticated user can use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out-of-bounds write on HyperLogLog operations, which can lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2025-21605) An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers until the server runs out of memory or is terminated, which can lead to denial-of-service.

Redis 7.2.x:

- (CVE-2025-32023) An authenticated user can use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out-of-bounds write on HyperLogLog operations, which can lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2025-21605) An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers until the server runs out of memory or is terminated, which can lead to denial-of-service.

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.2.1)

Redis 7.0.x:

- (CVE-2024-31449) An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

- (CVE-2024-31228) An authenticated user can trigger a denial-of-service by using specially crafted, long string match patterns on supported commands such as `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `FUNCTION LIST`, `COMMAND LIST`, and ACL definitions. Matching of extremely long patterns may result in unbounded recursion, leading to stack overflow and process crashes.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.0.13)

- (CVE-2023-36824) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption, and potentially remote code execution. Specifically: using `COMMAND GETKEYS*` and validation of key names in ACL rules. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 7.0.11)

- (CVE-2023-28425) Specially crafted `MSETNX` commands can lead to assertion and denial-of-service. (Redis 7.0.10)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 7.0.8)

- (CVE-2022-35951) Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument, may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.5)

- (CVE-2022-31144) A specially crafted `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state may result in heap overflow and potentially remote code execution. The problem affects Redis versions 7.0.0 or newer. (Redis 7.0.4)

- (CVE-2022-24834) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.
