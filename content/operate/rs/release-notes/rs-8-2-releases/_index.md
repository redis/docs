## Version changes

### Breaking changes

Redis Software version 8.2.0 introduces the following breaking changes:

- **Local import from Redis Software system directories is no longer supported.** To improve security, database imports that use the `mount_point` source can no longer read files from Redis Software system directories, including `/opt/redislabs`, `/var/opt/redislabs`, `/etc/opt/redislabs`, and any of their subdirectories.

    - Import operations that reference files in these directories now fail.

    - Store import files in a non-system location accessible to Redis Software before you start the import.

- **`smtp_password` is now a write-only field in the Cluster API.** To improve security, the API no longer returns the SMTP password in responses to `GET /v1/cluster`, and the Cluster Manager UI no longer reads or displays the existing password.

    - Applications or scripts that previously expected `smtp_password` to be returned by the Cluster API no longer receive this field.

    - When you update SMTP settings, the existing password cannot be retrieved. To change the SMTP password, provide a new password as part of the update request.

- **Custom module upload is disabled by default.** To improve security, custom (user-defined) module uploads are now disabled by default. A new cluster setting, `allow_modules_upload`, controls access to the custom module upload APIs. When this setting is disabled (the default), requests to `POST /v2/modules/user-defined` and `POST /v2/local/modules/user-defined/artifacts` return `403 modules_upload_disabled`, regardless of user role.

    - To enable custom module uploads, set `allow_modules_upload` to `true` with a `PUT /v1/cluster` request.

    - Applications or automation that call the custom module upload APIs directly receive a `403 modules_upload_disabled` response until the setting is enabled.

    - Existing functionality for listing, deleting, and loading modules is unchanged.

### OpenSSL version

Redis Software version 8.0.16 and later requires OpenSSL 3.3 or later.

### Reserved ports

Make sure the following ports are open before upgrading Redis Software.

The following port was added as a reserved port in Redis Software version 8.0.18; however, it is optional instead of reserved in Redis Software version 8.0.20-44:

| Port | Process name | Usage |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 3357 | reconciliation_tree_grpc | Internal communication |

Ports reserved as of Redis Software version 7.22.0:

| Port | Process name | Usage | 
|------|--------------|-------|
| 3346 | cluster_api_internal | Cluster API internal port |
| 3351 | cluster_watchdog_grpc_api | Cluster watchdog now supports gRPC |
| 3352 | grpc_service_mesh | gRPC communication between nodes |
| 3353 | local_grpc_service_mesh | Local gRPC services |
| 3354 | grpc_gossip_envoy | gRPC gossip protocol communication between nodes |
| 3355 | authentication_service | Authentication service internal port |

Ports reserved as of Redis Software version 7.8.2:

| Port | Process name | Usage | 
|------|--------------|-------|
| 3347 | cert_exporter | Reports cluster certificate metrics |
| 3348 | process_exporter | Reports process metrics for DMC and Redis processes |
| 3349 | cluster_wd_exporter | Reports cluster watchdog metrics |
| 3350 | db_controller | Internode communication |
| 9091 | node_exporter | Reports host node metrics related to CPU, memory, disk, and more |
| 9125 | statsd_exporter | Reports push metrics related to the DMC and syncer, and some cluster and node metrics |

See [Ports and port ranges used by Redis Software]({{<relref "/operate/rs/networking/port-configurations#ports-and-port-ranges-used-by-redis-software">}}) for a complete list.

### Deprecations

#### API deprecations

- The `db_conns_auditing` cluster policy and database configuration field is deprecated. Use the `audit_settings.audit_mode` field instead. Setting `db_conns_auditing` to `true` is equivalent to setting `audit_mode` to `connection`. See [Audit events]({{<relref "/operate/rs/security/audit-events">}}) for the current auditing configuration.

- The `gradual_src_mode`, `gradual_sync_mode`, and `gradual_sync_max_shards_per_source` parameters are deprecated. Use `gradual_sync_policy` instead. You can set it with [`rladmin tune db`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/tune">}}) or the REST API.

- The `old_password` field in `POST /v1/users/password` and `PUT /v1/users/password` requests is deprecated and ignored. It was optional and had no effect when adding or resetting a password, so you can remove it from these requests. `old_password` is still required for `DELETE /v1/users/password`, which uses it to identify the password to delete.

- The following REST API fields, deprecated since Redis Software version 6.4.2, are removed in this release:

    - `use_ipv6` (cluster object) — use `use_external_ipv6` instead.

    - `redis_cleanup_job_settings` (job scheduler object) — use `persistence_cleanup_scan_interval` instead.

#### Internal monitoring and v1 Prometheus metrics deprecation

The existing [internal monitoring engine]({{<relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/v1_monitoring">}}) is deprecated. We recommend transitioning to the new [metrics stream engine]({{<relref "/operate/rs/monitoring/metrics_stream_engine">}}) for improved performance, enhanced integration capabilities, and modernized metrics streaming.

V1 Prometheus metrics are deprecated but still available. To transition to the new metrics stream engine, either migrate your existing dashboards using [this guide]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/metrics/prometheus-metrics-v1-to-v2">}}) or use [new preconfigured dashboards]({{<relref "/integrate/prometheus-with-redis-enterprise#grafana-dashboards-for-redis-software">}}).

As part of the transition to the metrics stream engine, some internal cluster manager alerts were deprecated in favor of external monitoring solutions. See the [alerts transition plan]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/alerts/alerts-v1-to-v2">}}) for guidance.

### Supported platforms

The following table provides a snapshot of supported platforms as of this Redis Software release. See the [supported platforms reference]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/supported-platforms" >}}) for more details about operating system compatibility.

<span title="Check mark icon">&#x2705;</span> Supported – The platform is supported for this version of Redis Software and Redis Stack modules.

<span title="Warning icon" class="font-serif">:warning:</span> Deprecation warning – The platform is still supported for this version of Redis Software, but support will be removed in a future release.

## Known issues

- RS155734: Endpoint availability metrics do not work as expected due to a calculation error.

## Known limitations

#### Redis Search query failures during rolling upgrades across the 8.4 version boundary

Redis Search queries can fail during a rolling upgrade when a cluster contains shards running Redis versions earlier than 8.4 and shards running Redis version 8.4 or later, due to an internal protocol change introduced in version 8.4. This issue affects only clusters where `parallel_shards_upgrade` has been changed from its default value of `0`. If both conditions apply, expect Redis Search downtime until all nodes are upgraded.

#### Trim ACKED not supported for Active-Active 8.4 databases

For Active-Active databases running Redis database version 8.4, the `ACKED` option is not supported for trimming commands.

#### Rolling upgrade limitation for clusters with custom or deprecated modules

Due to module handling changes introduced in Redis Software version 8.0, upgrading a cluster that contains custom or deprecated modules, such as RedisGraph and RedisGears v2, can become stuck when adding a new node to the cluster during a rolling upgrade.

#### Module commands limitation during Active-Active database upgrades to Redis 8.0

When upgrading an Active-Active database to Redis version 8.0, you cannot use module commands until all Active-Active database instances have been upgraded. Currently, these commands are not blocked automatically.

#### Redis 8.0 database cannot be created with flash

You cannot create a Redis 8.0 database with flash storage enabled. Create a Redis 8.0 database with RAM-only storage instead, or use Redis 8.2 for flash-enabled (Redis Flex) databases.

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance" >}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.
