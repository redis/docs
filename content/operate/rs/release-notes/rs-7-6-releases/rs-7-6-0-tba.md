​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 7.6.0](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/download-center/software/) is now available!

## Highlights

This version offers:

- Client-side caching support

- Cluster Manager UI enhancements for node actions, database tags, and database configuration

- Log rotation based on both size and time

- Module management enhancements

## New in this release

### New features

- Client-side caching support:

    - Client-side caching allows Redis clients to store a subset of data in a local cache and avoid sending repeated requests to the Redis database.
    
    - When used to cache frequently accessed data, this technique can improve performance by decreasing network traffic, latency, and load on the database.

    - Supported for Redis databases with Redis versions 7.4 and later.
    
    - For more information, see the [client-side caching introduction]({{<relref "/develop/connect/clients/client-side-caching">}}) and [client-side caching compatibility with Redis Software]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/compatibility/client-side-caching">}}).

### Enhancements

- New Cluster Manager UI enhancements:

    - Perform node actions from the **Nodes** screen to verify nodes, set a node as primary or secondary, remove nodes, and manage node alert settings.

    - Categorize databases with custom tags. When you add new tags to a database, the keys and values already used by existing tags will appear as suggestions.

    - Moved several settings on the database configuration screen:
    
        - The eviction setting now appears in the **Capacity** section.

        - **High availability** and **Durability** have separate sections.

- Added support for [log rotation]({{<relref "/operate/rs/clusters/logging/log-security#log-rotation">}}) based on both size and time.

#### Redis module feature sets

Redis Enterprise comes packaged with several modules. As of version 7.6.0, Redis Enterprise includes three feature sets, compatible with different Redis database versions.

The following table shows which Redis modules are compatible with each Redis database version included in this release.

| Redis database version | Compatible Redis modules |
|------------------------|--------------------------|

1. <a name="module-note-1"></a>RedisGraph end-of-life has been announced and will be removed in a future release. See the [RedisGraph end-of-life announcement](https://redis.io/blog/redisgraph-eol/) for more details.

### Resolved issues

- RS130444: Fixed an issue that prevented creating or editing users without an email address in the Cluster Manager UI.

- RS121796: The "multiple endpoint" configuration database default setting should also enable sharding when selected.

- RS128768: Fixed a bug that prevented metric graph timestamp details from displaying in the Cluster Manager UI.

- RS127120: 

- RS127054: Fixed an issue where the install script incorrectly reported "Port 53 is occupied" instead of the correct value of the occupied port.

- RS125934:

- RS125412: 

- RS131360: 

- RS123645: Fixed inconsistent behavior for shard creation when you enable sharding.

- RS122012: Fixed an issue that sent a cutoff email message for long-running alerts.

- RS121726: Block the `remove_shards` option for `rlutil`. You can use Replica Of to decrease the shard count instead.

- RS121076: Added a 5-minute connection timeout when promoting a replica shard to a primary role.

- RS118144:

- RS118103: Removed the inaccurate shard `BACKUP_PROGRESS` column from the `rladmin status` command's output.

- RS116990:

- RS114258: 

## Version changes

- Added validation to verify the LDAP server URI contains a host and port when updating LDAP configuration.

### Breaking changes

Redis Enterprise Software version 7.6.0 introduces the following breaking changes:

- The default value of `latest_with_modules` has changed to `true`.

    - [`rladmin upgrade db`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade#upgrade-db">}}) will always upgrade the database's modules.

    - When you [upgrade a database]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/upgrade#post-bdbs-upgrade">}}) using the REST API, you can set `"latest_with_modules": false` in the request body to prevent module upgrades.

### Product lifecycle updates

#### End-of-life policy extension

The end-of-life policy for Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2 and later has been extended to 24 months after the formal release of the subsequent major version. For the updated end-of-life schedule, see the [Redis Enterprise Software product lifecycle]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/product-lifecycle">}}).

#### Supported upgrade paths

Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2.4 and 6.2.8 do not support direct upgrades beyond version 7.4.x. Versions 6.2.10, 6.2.12, and 6.2.18 are part of the [upgrade path]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/upgrade-cluster#supported-upgrade-paths">}}). To upgrade from 6.2.4 or 6.2.8 to versions later than 7.4.x, an intermediate upgrade is required.

The next major Redis Enterprise Software release will still bundle Redis database version 6.2 and allow database upgrades from Redis database version 6.2 to 7.x.

See the [Redis Enterprise Software product lifecycle]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/product-lifecycle">}}) for more information about release numbers.

#### End of triggers and functions preview

The [triggers and functions]({{<relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions">}}) (RedisGears) preview has been discontinued.

- Commands such as `TFCALL`, `TFCALLASYNC`, and `TFUNCTION` will be deprecated and will return error messages.

- Any JavaScript functions stored in Redis will be removed. 

- JavaScript-based triggers will be blocked.

- Lua functions and scripts will not be affected.

If your database currently uses triggers and functions, you need to: 

1. Adjust your applications to accommodate these changes.

1. Delete all triggers and functions libraries from your existing database:

    1. Run `TFUNCTION LIST`.

    1. Copy all library names.

    1. Run `TFUNCTION DELETE` for each library in the list.

    If any triggers and functions libraries remain in the database, the RDB snapshot won't load on a cluster without RedisGears.

1. Migrate your database to a new database without the RedisGears module.

### Deprecations

#### API deprecations

- Deprecated `background_op` field from BDB REST API object. Use [`GET /v1/actions/bdb/<bdb_uid>`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/actions/bdb">}}) instead.

- Deprecated module fields:

    - `latest_with_modules`:

        - The default value of `latest_with_modules` has changed to `true`.

        - [`rladmin upgrade db`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade#upgrade-db">}}) will always upgrade the database's modules.

        - When you [upgrade a database]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/upgrade#post-bdbs-upgrade">}}) using the REST API, you can set `"latest_with_modules": false` in the request body to prevent module upgrades.

    - `keep_redis_version`; use `redis_version` instead

    - `current_module`; use `new_module_args` instead

    - `new_module`; use `new_module_args` instead

    - `module_id`; use `module_name` instead

    - `semantic_version`; use module_args instead

    - `min_redis_version` is only relevant to Redis database versions earlier than 7.4; replaced with `compatible_redis_version`

- Deprecated the [`rladmin upgrade modules`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade#upgrade-module">}}) command. Use [`rladmin upgrade db`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade#upgrade-db">}}) instead.

- Deprecated [`POST /v1/modules/upgrade/bdb/<uid>`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/modules/upgrade#post-modules-upgrade-bdb">}}) REST API request. Use [`POST /v1/bdbs/<uid>/upgrade`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/upgrade#post-bdbs-upgrade">}}) to upgrade modules instead.

#### Download center modules deprecation

New Redis modules will not be available for download from the Redis download center.

#### Legacy UI deprecation

The legacy UI is deprecated in favor of the new Cluster Manager UI and will be removed in a future release.

#### Redis 6.0 database deprecation

Redis database version 6.0 is deprecated as of Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2 and will be removed in a future release.

To prepare for the future removal of Redis 6.0:

- For Redis Enterprise 6.2.* clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 6.2. See the [Redis 6.2 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.2/00-RELEASENOTES) for the list of changes.

- For Redis Enterprise 7.2.4 and 7.4.2 clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 7.2. Before you upgrade your databases, see the list of [Redis 7.2 breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52#redis-72-breaking-changes" >}}) and update any applications that connect to your database to handle these changes.

### Upcoming changes

#### Default image change for Redis Enterprise Software containers

Starting with version 7.6, Redis Enterprise Software containers with the image tag `x.y.z-build` will be based on RHEL instead of Ubuntu.

This change will only affect you if you use containers outside the official [Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes]({{<relref "/operate/kubernetes">}}) product and use Ubuntu-specific commands.

To use Ubuntu-based images after this change, you can specify the operating system suffix in the image tag. For example, use the image tag `7.4.2-216.focal` instead of `7.4.2-216`.

### Supported platforms

The following table provides a snapshot of supported platforms as of this Redis Enterprise Software release. See the [supported platforms reference]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/supported-platforms" >}}) for more details about operating system compatibility.

## Known issues

- RS131972: Creating an ACL that contains a line break in the Cluster Manager UI can cause shard migration to fail due to ACL errors.

## Known limitations

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance" >}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.

#### RedisGraph prevents upgrade to RHEL 9 

You cannot upgrade from a prior RHEL version to RHEL 9 if the Redis Enterprise cluster contains a RedisGraph module, even if unused by any database. The [RedisGraph module has reached End-of-Life](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/) and is completely unavailable in RHEL 9.

## Security

#### Open source Redis security fixes compatibility

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Enterprise Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) available with [open source Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis Enterprise has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs.

Some CVEs announced for open source Redis do not affect Redis Enterprise due to different or additional functionality available in Redis Enterprise that is not available in open source Redis.

Redis Enterprise 7.6.0-tba supports open source Redis 7.2, 6.2, and 6.0. Below is the list of open source Redis CVEs fixed by version.

Redis 7.2.x:

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.2.1)

Redis 7.0.x:

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2021-32625) An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer can be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. (Redis 6.2.4)

- (CVE-2021-29478) An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration value, creating a large set key that consists of integer values and using the COPY command to duplicate it. The integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with 2.6, where it could result with a corrupted RDB or DUMP payload, but not exploited through COPY (which did not exist before 6.2). (Redis 6.2.3)

- (CVE-2021-29477) An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result in remote code execution. The integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with 6.0. (Redis 6.2.3)

Redis 6.0.x:

- (CVE-2022-24834) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects only authenticated and authorized users. (Redis 6.0.20)

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 6.0.19)

- (CVE-2023-25155) Specially crafted `SRANDMEMBER`, `ZRANDMEMBER`, and `HRANDFIELD` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting in a runtime assertion and termination of the Redis server process. (Redis 6.0.18)

- (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis can cause it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. (Redis 6.0.18)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 6.0.17)
