## Version changes

### Product lifecycle updates

#### End-of-life policy extension

The end-of-life policy for Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2 and later has been extended to 24 months after the formal release of the subsequent major version. For the updated end-of-life schedule, see the [Redis Enterprise Software product lifecycle]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/product-lifecycle">}}).

#### Supported upgrade paths

Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2.4 and 6.2.8 do not support direct upgrades beyond version 7.4.x. Versions 6.2.10, 6.2.12, and 6.2.18 are part of the [upgrade path]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/upgrade-cluster#supported-upgrade-paths">}}). To upgrade from 6.2.4 or 6.2.8 to versions later than 7.4.x, an intermediate upgrade is required.

The next major Redis Enterprise Software release will still bundle Redis database version 6.2 and allow database upgrades from Redis database version 6.2 to 7.x.

See the [Redis Enterprise Software product lifecycle]({{<relref "/operate/rs/installing-upgrading/product-lifecycle">}}) for more information about release numbers.

### Deprecations

#### API deprecations

- The replica HA cluster policy is deprecated.

- The maintenance mode option `keep_slave_shards` is deprecated in `rladmin` and the REST API. Use `evict_ha_replica` and `evict_active_active_replica` instead.

- `/v1/debuginfo` REST API paths are deprecated. Use the new paths [`/v1/cluster/debuginfo`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster/debuginfo" >}}), [`/v1/nodes/debuginfo`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/nodes/debuginfo" >}}), and [`/v1/bdbs/debuginfo`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs/debuginfo" >}}) instead.

#### Legacy UI deprecation

The legacy UI is deprecated in favor of the new Cluster Manager UI and will be removed in a future release.

#### Redis 6.0 database deprecation

Redis database version 6.0 is deprecated as of Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2 and will be removed in a future release.

To prepare for the future removal of Redis 6.0:

- For Redis Enterprise 6.2.* clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 6.2. See the [Redis 6.2 release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.2/00-RELEASENOTES) for the list of changes.

- For Redis Enterprise 7.2.4 and 7.4.2 clusters, upgrade Redis 6.0 databases to Redis 7.2. Before you upgrade your databases, see the list of [Redis 7.2 breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases/rs-7-2-4-52#redis-72-breaking-changes" >}}) and update any applications that connect to your database to handle these changes.

#### Operating system retirements

- RHEL 7 and Oracle Linux 7 were previously announced as deprecated in the [Redis Enterprise Software 7.2.4 release notes]({{< relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-2-4-releases#deprecations" >}}). As of Redis Enterprise Software 7.4.2, RHEL 7 and Oracle Linux 7 are no longer supported.

#### Security retirements

- The RC4 encryption cipher, which was previously deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers, is no longer supported.

- The 3DES encryption cipher, which was previously deprecated in favor of stronger ciphers like AES, is no longer supported. Verify that all clients, applications, and connections support the AES cipher.

- TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 connections, which were previously deprecated in favor of TLS 1.2 or later, are no longer supported. Verify that all clients, applications, and connections support TLS 1.2 or later.

### Upcoming changes

#### Default image change for Redis Enterprise Software containers

Starting with version 7.6, Redis Enterprise Software containers with the image tag `x.y.z-build` will be based on RHEL instead of Ubuntu.

This change will only affect you if you use containers outside the official [Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes]({{<relref "/operate/kubernetes">}}) product and use Ubuntu-specific commands.

To use Ubuntu-based images after this change, you can specify the operating system suffix in the image tag. For example, use the image tag `7.4.2-216.focal` instead of `7.4.2-216`.

### Supported platforms

The following table provides a snapshot of supported platforms as of this Redis Enterprise Software release. See the [supported platforms reference]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/supported-platforms" >}}) for more details about operating system compatibility.

<span title="Check mark icon">&#x2705;</span> Supported – The platform is supported for this version of Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Stack modules.

<span title="Warning icon" class="font-serif">:warning:</span> Deprecation warning – The platform is still supported for this version of Redis Enterprise Software, but support will be removed in a future release.

## Known issues

- RS61676: Full chain certificate update fails if any certificate in the chain does not have a Common Name (CN).

- RS119958: The `debuginfo` script fails with the error `/bin/tar: Argument list too long` if there are too many RocksDB log files. This issue only affects clusters with Auto Tiering.

- RS122570: REST API `POST /crdbs` responds with a confusing error message if the cluster does not have the requested CRDB-compatible module that complies with the requested featureset.

    This issue was fixed in [Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-126]({{<relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-4-2-releases/rs-7-4-2-126">}}).

- RS123142: In an Active-Active setup with at least three participating clusters, removing and re-adding a cluster after removing older clusters without re-adding them can cause missing keys and potentially lead to data loss or data inconsistency.

    To prevent this issue, avoid adding clusters until you upgrade to the upcoming maintenance release when available.

    This issue was fixed in [Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-169]({{<relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-4-2-releases/rs-7-4-2-169">}}).

## Known limitations

#### New Cluster Manager UI limitations

The following legacy UI features are not yet available in the new Cluster Manager UI:

- Remove a node.

    Use the REST API or legacy UI instead. See [Remove a cluster node]({{< relref "/operate/rs/clusters/remove-node" >}}) for instructions.

- Purge an Active-Active instance.

    Use [`crdb-cli crdb purge-instance`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/crdb-cli/crdb/purge-instance" >}}) instead.

- Search and export the log.

#### OpenSSL compatibility issue for 7.4.2 modules on Amazon Linux 2

Due to an OpenSSL 1.1 compatibility issue between modules and clusters, Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-54 is not fully supported on Amazon Linux 2 clusters with databases that use the following modules: RedisGears, RediSearch, or RedisTimeSeries.

This issue will be fixed in a future maintenance release.

#### RedisGraph prevents upgrade to RHEL 9 

You cannot upgrade from a prior RHEL version to RHEL 9 if the Redis Enterprise cluster contains a RedisGraph module, even if unused by any database. The [RedisGraph module has reached End-of-Life](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/) and is completely unavailable in RHEL 9.

#### Cannot create Redis v6.x Active-Active databases with modules

You cannot create Active-Active databases that use Redis version 6.0 or 6.2 with modules. Databases that use Redis version 7.2 do not have this limitation.

This limitation was fixed in [Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-104]({{< relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-4-2-releases/rs-7-4-2-104" >}}).

#### Firewalld configuration fails on RHEL 9 due to file permissions

When you install Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2 on RHEL 9, `firewalld` configuration fails to add the `redislabs` service if `/etc/firewalld/services/redislabs-clients.xml` and `/etc/firewalld/services/redislabs.xml` are owned by `redislabs` instead of `root`.

As a workaround:

1. Change the files' owner and group to `root`: 

    ```sh
    $ chown root:root /etc/firewalld/services/redislabs-clients.xml
    $ chown root:root /etc/firewalld/services/redislabs.xml
    ```

1. Add the `redislabs` service to `firewalld`:

    ```sh
    $ systemctl daemon-reload
    $ systemctl restart firewalls
    $ /bin/firewall-cmd --add-service=redislabs
    ```

This limitation was fixed in [Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2-129]({{<relref "/operate/rs/release-notes/rs-7-4-2-releases/rs-7-4-2-129">}}).
