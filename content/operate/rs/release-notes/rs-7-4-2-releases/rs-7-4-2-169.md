This is a maintenance release for ​[​Redis Enterprise Software version 7.4.2](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/download-center/software/).

## Highlights

This version offers:

- Configuration options for cluster management API workers and threads

- Reduced Cluster Configuration Store CPU usage

- Bug fixes

## New in this release

### Enhancements

- Allow configuring `cnm_http_workers` and `cnm_http_max_threads_per_worker` using a [`PUT /v1/cluster`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/requests/cluster#put-cluster">}}) REST API request. You can update these settings if the API load is higher than the cluster can handle by default. Configuring more workers than the default will consume more memory.

- Reduced Cluster Configuration Store CPU usage, following the addition of the internal caching mechanism in the resource management calculations.

#### Redis module feature sets

Redis Enterprise comes packaged with several modules. As of version 7.4.2, Redis Enterprise includes two feature sets, compatible with different Redis database versions.

Bundled Redis modules compatible with Redis database version 7.2:

- [RediSearch 2.8.13]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.8-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisJSON 2.6.10]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.6-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisTimeSeries 1.10.12]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.10-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisBloom 2.6.12]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.6-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisGears 2.0.20](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases/tag/v2.0.20-m21)

Bundled Redis modules compatible with Redis database versions 6.0 and 6.2:

- [RediSearch 2.6.18]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.6-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisTimeSeries 1.8.13]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.8-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisBloom 2.4.9]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.4-release-notes.md" >}})

- [RedisGraph v2.10.15]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisgraph/redisgraph-2.10-release-notes.md" >}})

### Resolved issues

- RS123237: CRDT syncer prevents potential data mismatches or data loss due to missing keys when removing and re-adding a cluster in an Active-Active setup with at least three participating clusters after removing older clusters without re-adding them.

- RS93876: When resharding is performed with `shards_blueprint`, improved the order of resharding to avoid stuck state machines due to low memory.

- RS119350: Avoid removing roles bound to LDAP mappings during cluster upgrade even if the roles aren't assigned to any users.

- RS123561: Improved the installation validation process by identifying an occupied DNS port.

- RS122365: Improved platform and module readiness checks by ignoring operating systems that are no longer part of the cluster.

- RS96400: DMC management threads properly terminate instead of maintaining a blocking connection if they can't reach the CCS after a predefined time.

- RS117188: Replaced the policy cache mechanism. Cache data from the versions file.

- RS120425: Skip [`rlcheck`]({{<relref "/operate/rs/references/cli-utilities/rlcheck">}}) `ccs_dns` check when `pdns_server` is not enabled.

- RS118252: For databases with OSS Cluster API enabled, endpoints can bind to nodes that have master shards even if `max_listeners=0`.

- RS115382: Updated DMC to disconnect the client with an error if the token size exceeds `MAX_KEY_BULK_SIZE`.

- RS110798: Reduced `cluster_wd` request latency, fixing communication errors on large clusters.

- RS119705: On in-place upgrades, minimize DMC downtime by performing CCS schema upgrade before services are restarted.

- RS117224: Avoid RAM eviction during scripts.

- RS122062: Use `os_family` instead of `os_name` when creating module platforms during cluster upgrade, fixing join requests for operating systems like CentOS and Oracle Linux.

## Security

**Source available Redis security fixes compatibility**

As part of Redis's commitment to security, Redis Enterprise Software implements the latest [security fixes](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases) from [source available Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Redis Enterprise has already included the fixes for the relevant CVEs.

Some CVEs announced for Redis do not affect Redis Enterprise due to different or additional functionality in Redis Enterprise.

Redis Enterprise 7.4.2 supports Redis 7.2, 6.2, and 6.0. Below is the list of Redis CVEs fixed by version.

Redis 7.2.x:

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.2.1)

Redis 7.0.x:

- (CVE-2023-41056) In some cases, Redis may incorrectly handle resizing of memory buffers, which can result in incorrect accounting of buffer sizes and lead to heap overflow and potential remote code execution.

- (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by `SORT_RO` and, as a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration. (Redis 7.0.13)

- (CVE-2023-36824) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption, and potentially remote code execution. Specifically: using `COMMAND GETKEYS*` and validation of key names in ACL rules. (Redis 7.0.12)

- (CVE-2023-28856) Authenticated users can use the `HINCRBYFLOAT` command to create an invalid hash field that will crash Redis on access. (Redis 7.0.11)

- (CVE-2021-29478) An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration value, creating a large set key that consists of integer values and using the COPY command to duplicate it. The integer overflow bug exists in all versions of Redis starting with 2.6, where it could result with a corrupted RDB or DUMP payload, but not exploited through COPY (which did not exist before 6.2). (Redis 6.2.3)

- (CVE-2022-36021) String matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis can cause it to hang and consume 100% CPU time. (Redis 6.0.18)

- (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis `SETRANGE` and `SORT`/`SORT_RO` commands can drive Redis to OOM panic. (Redis 6.0.17)
