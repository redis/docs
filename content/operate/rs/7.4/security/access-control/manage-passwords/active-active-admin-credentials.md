Active-Active databases use administrator credentials to manage operations.

To update the administrator user password on a cluster with Active-Active databases:

1. From the user management page, update the administrator user password on the clusters you want to update.

1. For each participating cluster _and_ each Active-Active database, update the admin user credentials to match the changes in step 1. 

{{<warning>}}
Do not perform any management operations on the databases until these steps are complete.
