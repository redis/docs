You can view, configure, and enable various alerts for the cluster.

Alerts are bound to a cluster object (such as a [BDB]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/objects/bdb" >}}) or [node]({{< relref "/operate/rs/references/rest-api/objects/node" >}})), and the cluster's state determines whether the alerts turn on or off.
