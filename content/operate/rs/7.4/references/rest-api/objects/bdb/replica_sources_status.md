The `replica_sources` status field relates to the [Replica Of]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/import-export/replica-of/create.md" >}}) feature, which enables the creation of a Redis database (single- or multi-shard) that synchronizes data from another Redis database (single- or multi-shard).

The status field represents the Replica Of sync status for a specific sync source.

Possible status values:

| Status | Description | Possible next status |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| 'out-of-sync' | Sync process is disconnected from source and trying to reconnect | 'syncing' |
| 'syncing' | Sync process is in progress | 'in-sync' <br />'out-of-sync' |
| 'in-sync' | Sync process finished successfully, and new commands are syncing on a regular basis | 'syncing' <br />'out-of-sync'
