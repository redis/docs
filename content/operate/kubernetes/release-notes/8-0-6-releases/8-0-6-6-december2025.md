## API changes

| **CRD** | **Field** | **Change** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|---|
| REAADB | `spec.globalConfigurations.auditing` | Added | Enable database connection auditing. |
| REAADB | `spec.globalConfigurations.alertSettings` | Added | Configure alert settings for the active-active database. |
| REAADB | `spec.globalConfigurations.rofRamRatio` | Added | RAM allocation ratio for Redis Flex (v2) databases as a percentage of total data size. Valid range: 0-100. Default: 50% when omitted. Controls how much RAM is allocated per unit of data (for example, 30% means 3MB RAM per 10MB data). RAM grows proportionally with data until `rofRamSize` limit is reached (if specified). Only applicable when `isRof=true` and Redis version 8.0 or later (BigStore v2 - Redis Flex). |
| REC | `spec.auditing` | Added | Cluster-level configuration for auditing database connection and authentication events. Includes both the audit listener connection parameters and the default policy for new databases. |
| REC | `spec.sso` | Added | Cluster-level SSO configuration for authentication to the cluster manager UI. |
| REC | `spec.userDefinedModules` | Added | List of user-defined modules to be downloaded and installed during cluster bootstrap. The modules on the list will be downloaded on cluster creation, upgrade, scale-out, and recovery and installed on all nodes. Changing this field for a running cluster will trigger a rolling update. |
| REC | `spec.certificates.ssoServiceCertificateSecretName` | Added | Secret name for the cluster's SSO service certificate. Used for SAML-based SSO authentication to the cluster manager. The secret must contain `name`, `certificate`, and `key` fields (same format as other cluster certificates). If left blank, SSO will not be configured. |
| REC | `spec.certificates.ssoIssuerCertificateSecretName` | Added | Secret name for the SSO Identity Provider (IdP) certificate. This is the public certificate from your SAML Identity Provider used to verify SAML assertions. The secret must contain `name` and `certificate` fields (no `key` field needed for IdP certificate). This is optional - if using IdP metadata XML, the IdP certificate is included in the metadata. |
| REDB | `spec.auditing` | Added | Database-level auditing configuration. |
| REDB | `spec.rofRamRatio` | Added | RAM allocation ratio for Redis Flex (v2) databases as a percentage of total data size. Valid range: 0-100. Default: 50% when omitted. Controls how much RAM is allocated per unit of data (for example, 30% means 3MB RAM per 10MB data). RAM grows proportionally with data until `rofRamSize` limit is reached (if specified). Only applicable when `isRof=true` and Redis version 8.0 or later (BigStore v2 - Redis Flex). |
| REDB | `status.bigstoreVersion` | Added | BigStore version for Redis on Flash databases (1 for Auto Tiering, 2 for Redis Flex). Read-only field populated from Redis Software. |
