Internode encryption provides added security by encrypting communication between nodes in your Redis Enterprise cluster (REC).

Enable internode encryption in the `spec` section of your REC custom resource file.

```yaml
spec:
    dataInternodeEncryption: true
```

This change will apply to all databases created in the REC. You can override the cluster-wide setting for individual databases.

Edit your Redis Enterprise database (REDB) custom resource file to disable internode encryption for only that database.

```yaml
spec: 
    dataInternodeEncryption: false
```

To learn more about internode encryption, see [Internode encryption for Redis Enterprise Software]({{< relref "/operate/rs/security/encryption/internode-encryption.md" >}}).
