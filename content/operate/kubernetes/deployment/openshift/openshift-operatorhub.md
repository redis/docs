You can deploy Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes from the Red Hat OpenShift CLI. You can also use a UI, [OperatorHub](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/operators/index.html) (Red Hat) to install operators and create custom resources.

To see which version of Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes supports your OpenShift version, see [Supported Kubernetes distributions]({{< relref "/operate/kubernetes/reference/supported_k8s_distributions" >}}).

## Install the Redis Enterprise operator

{{<warning>}} If using version 6.2.18-41 or earlier, [Install the security context constraint](#install-security-context-constraint) before installing the operator. {{</warning>}}

1. Select **Operators > OperatorHub**.

2. Search for _Redis Enterprise_ in the search dialog and select the **Redis Enterprise Operator provided by Redis** marked as **Certified**.

    By default, the image is pulled from Red Hat's registry.

3. On the **Install Operator** page, specify the namespace for the operator.

    Only one namespace per operator is supported.

4. Update the **channel** with the version you're installing.

    For more information about specific versions, see the [release notes]({{< relref "/operate/kubernetes/release-notes/" >}}).

5. Choose an approval strategy.

    Use **Manual** for production systems to ensure the operator is only upgraded by approval.

6. Select **Install** and approve the install plan.

   You can monitor the subscription status in **Operators > Installed Operators**.

{{<warning>}}DO NOT modify or delete the StatefulSet created during the deployment process. Doing so could destroy your Redis Enterprise cluster (REC).{{</warning>}}

## Install security context constraint

The Redis Enterprise pods must run in OpenShift with privileges set in a [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html#security-context-constraints-about_configuring-internal-oauth). This grants the pod various rights, such as the ability to change system limits or run as a particular user.

{{<warning>}}
 Before creating any clusters, install the security context constraint (SCC) for the operator in [scc.yaml](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-enterprise-k8s-docs/blob/master/openshift/scc.yaml).
{{</warning>}}

You only need to install the SCC once, but you must not delete it.

1. Select the project you'll be using or create a new project.

1. Download [`scc.yaml`](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-enterprise-k8s-docs/blob/master/openshift/scc.yaml).

1. Apply the file to install the security context constraint.

  ```sh
  oc apply -f scc.yaml
  ```

After the install, the OperatorHub automatically uses the constraint for Redis Enterprise node pods.

{{< note >}}
If you are using the recommended RedisEnterpriseCluster name of `rec`, the SCC is automatically bound to the RedisEnterpriseCluster after install.

If you choose a different name for the RedisEnterpriseCluster, or override the default service account name, you must manually bind the SCC to the RedisEnterpriseClusterâ€™s service account:

  ```sh
  oc adm policy add-scc-to-user redis-enterprise-scc-v2 \
  system:serviceaccount:<my-project>:<rec-service-account-name>
  ```

{{< /note >}}

## Create Redis Enterprise custom resources

The **Installed Operators**->**Operator details** page shows the provided APIs: **RedisEnterpriseCluster** and **RedisEnterpriseDatabase**. You can select **Create instance** to create custom resources using the OperatorHub interface.

Use the YAML view to create a custom resource file or let OperatorHub generate the YAML file for you by specifying your configuration options in the form view.

<note> The REC name cannot be changed after cluster creation.</note>

{{<note>}} In versions 6.4.2-4 and 6.4.2-5, REC creation might fail when using the form view due to an error related to the cluster level LDAP. To avoid this, use the YAML view.
{{</note>}}

For more information on creating and maintaining Redis Enterprise custom resources, see [Redis Enterprise clusters (REC)]({{< relref "/operate/kubernetes/re-clusters/" >}}) and [Redis Enterprise databases (REDB)]({{< relref "/operate/kubernetes/re-databases/" >}}).
