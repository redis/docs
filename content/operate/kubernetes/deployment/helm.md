Helm charts provide a simple way to install the Redis Enterprise for Kubernetes operator in just a few steps. For more information about Helm, go to [https://helm.sh/docs/](https://helm.sh/docs/).

{{<note>}} This feature is currently in public preview and is not supported on production workloads. Only new installations of the Redis operator are supported at this time. The steps for [creating the RedisEnterpriseCluster (REC)]({{<relref "operate/kubernetes/deployment/quick-start#create-a-redis-enterprise-cluster-rec">}}) and other custom resources remain the same.{{</note>}}

## Prerequisites

- A [supported distribution]({{< relref "/operate/kubernetes/reference/supported_k8s_distributions" >}}) of Kubernetes.
- At least three worker nodes.
- [Kubernetes client (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
- [Helm 3.10 or later](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Example values

The steps below use the following placeholders to indicate command line parameters you must provide:

- `<repo-name>` is the name of the repo holding your Helm chart (example: `redis`).
- `<release-name>` is the name you give a specific installation of the Helm chart (example: `my-redis-enterprise-operator`)
- `<chart-version>` is the version of the Helm chart you are installing (example: `7.8.2-2`)
- `<namespace-name>` is the name of the new namespace the Redis operator will run in (example: `ns1`)
- `<path-to-chart>` is the filepath to the Helm chart, if it is stored in a local directory (example: `/home/charts/redis-enterprise-operator`)

## Install

1. Add the Redis repository.

```sh
helm repo add <repo-name> https://helm.redis.io/
```

2. Install the Helm chart into a new namespace.

```sh
helm install <release-name> redis/redis-enterprise-operator \
    --version <chart-version> \
    --namespace <namespace-name> \
    --create-namespace
```

To install with Openshift, add `--set openshift.mode=true`.

To monitor the installation add the `--debug` flag. The installation runs several jobs synchronously and may take a few minutes to complete.

### Install from local directory

1. Find the latest release on the [redis-enterprise-k8s-docs](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-enterprise-k8s-docs/releases) repo and download the `tar.gz` source code into a local directory.

2. Install the Helm chart from your local directory.

```sh
helm install <release-name> <path-to-chart> \
    --namespace <namespace-name> \
    --create-namespace
```

To install with Openshift, add `--set openshift.mode=true`.

To monitor the installation add the `--debug` flag. The installation runs several jobs synchronously and may take a few minutes to complete.

### Specify values during install

1. View configurable values with `helm show values <repo-name>/<chart-name>`.

2. Install the Helm chart, overriding specific value defaults using `--set`.

```sh
helm install <operator-name> redis/redis-enterprise-operator \
    --version <release-name> \
    --namespace <namespace-name> \
    --create-namespace
    --set <key1>=<value1> \
    --set <key2>=<value2>
```

### Install with values file

1. View configurable values with `helm show values <repo-name>/<chart-name>`.

2. Create a YAML file to specify the values you want to configure.

3. Install the chart with the `--values` option.

```sh
helm install <operator-name> redis/redis-enterprise-operator \
    --version <release-name> \
    --namespace <namespace-name> \
    --create-namespace \
    --values <path-to-values-file>
```

## Uninstall

1. Delete any custom resources managed by the operator. See [Delete custom resources]({{<relref "operate/kubernetes/re-clusters/delete-custom-resources">}}) for detailed steps. You must delete custom resources in the correct order to avoid errors.

2. Uninstall the Helm chart.

```sh
helm uninstall <release-name>
```

This removes all Kubernetes resources associated with the chart and deletes the release.

{{<note>}}Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) installed by the chart are not removed during chart uninstallation. To remove them manually after uninstalling the chart, run `kubectl delete crds -l app=redis-enterprise`.{{</note>}}

## Known limitations

- Only new installations of the Redis operator are supported at this time. The steps for [creating the RedisEnterpriseCluster (REC)]({{<relref "operate/kubernetes/deployment/quick-start#create-a-redis-enterprise-cluster-rec">}}) and other custom resources remain the same.
- Upgrades and migrations are not supported.
- The chart doesn't include configuration options for multiple namespaces, rack-awareness, and Vault integration. The steps for configuring these options remain the same.
- The chart has had limited testing in advanced setups, including Active-Active configurations, air-gapped deployments, and IPv6/dual-stack environments.
