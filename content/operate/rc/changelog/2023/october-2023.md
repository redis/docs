## New features

### Cost report CSV download

You can now download shard cost reports in CSV format from the [**Billing and Payments**]({{< relref "/operate/rc/billing-and-payments" >}}) and [**Usage Reports**]({{< relref "/operate/rc/logs-reports/usage-reports" >}}) pages.

{{< embed-md "rc-cost-report-csv.md" >}}
### SAML account linking tokens

The process for [linking new Redis accounts]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso#link-other-accounts" >}}) to your [SAML single sign-on]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso" >}}) configuration has changed to enhance security. Now, both accounts must use a token to ensure that the connection is legitimate.
