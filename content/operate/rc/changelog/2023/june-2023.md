This changelog lists new features, enhancements, and other changes added to Redis Cloud during June 2023.

## New features

### Redis 7.2 fixed opt-in

You can opt in to Redis 7.2 on [Fixed subscriptions]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-essentials-database" >}}) in selected regions in AWS and GCP. Redis 7.2 introduces several changes to existing Redis commands; see the [list of breaking changes](#redis-72-breaking-changes) for more details.

### Export database list to CSV includes Active-Active

Your Active-Active databases will now appear in the database list when you export it to a CSV file. To support this, we added a "Region" column to differentiate between  Active-Active databases with the same name.

To export your database list to a CSV file, select **Export all** on the **Databases** screen.
