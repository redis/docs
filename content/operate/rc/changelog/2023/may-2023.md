This changelog lists new features, enhancements, and other changes added to Redis Cloud during May 2023.

## New features and enhancements

### Cloud API - Fixed plans support

The [Redis Cloud API]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api" >}}) supports new endpoints to manage fixed subscriptions and databases. 

The new fixed endpoints can be viewed in the [Redis Cloud Swagger UI](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#/Subscriptions%20-%20Fixed). For more information about using the Redis Cloud API, see [Use the REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/get-started/use-rest-api" >}}).

### Active-Active access roles

For [Active-Active databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/active-active-redis" >}}), you can now define roles with different levels of access for different regions.

For more information, see [Active-Active roles]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/active-active-roles" >}}).
