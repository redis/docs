This changelog lists new features, enhancements, and other changes added to Redis Cloud during August 2023.

## New features

### Redis 7.2 flexible opt-in

You can opt in to Redis 7.2 on [Flexible subscriptions]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-pro-database-new" >}}). Redis 7.2 introduces several changes to existing Redis commands; see the [list of breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rc/changelog/june-2023#redis-72-breaking-changes" >}}) published in June's changelog for more details.

### Triggers and functions preview

A preview of [triggers and functions]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions" >}}) (previously known as RedisGears) is now available in the following regions:

- AWS Asia Pacific - Singapore (`ap-southeast-1`)
- GCP Asia Pacific - Tokyo (`asia-northeast1`)

To use it, [create a fixed subscription]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-essentials-database" >}}) in one of these regions. Then, [create your database]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database" >}}) and set the database Type to Redis and select Triggers and Functions in the drop-down. Or, set the database Type to Redis Stack to get all of our advanced capabilities.

If you'd like to use triggers and functions with a [Flexible subscription]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-pro-database-new" >}}), contact [support](https://redis.com/company/support/).

For more information about triggers and functions, see the [triggers and functions documentation]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/" >}}).

{{< note >}}
Triggers and functions is discontinued as of [May 2024]({{< relref "/operate/rc/changelog/may-2024" >}}).

### Maintenance windows

You can now [set manual maintenance windows]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/maintenance/set-maintenance-windows" >}}) if you want to control when Redis can perform [maintenance]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/maintenance" >}}) for a Flexible subscription.

## Known issues

#### Invalid ACL rule causes failed state machine

Applying an invalid ACL rule to a database may cause a failed state machine. If this happens, use the [`PUT /v1/acl/redisRules/{aclRedisRuleId}`](https://api.redislabs.com/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#/Access%20Control%20List/updateRedisRule) API call to update the rule, and then delete it if necessary.
