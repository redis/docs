## New features

### Redis 8.2 on Redis Cloud Pro

Redis 8.2 is now available on Redis Cloud Pro. You can now upgrade your existing Pro database to Redis 8.2. 

See [upgrade database version]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/version-management/upgrade-version" >}}) to learn how to upgrade your existing Pro database to the latest version. If you are upgrading to Redis 8.2 from Redis 7.4 or earlier, review the [Redis 8.0 breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rc/changelog/version-release-notes/8-0#breaking-changes" >}}) before upgrading.

### Automatic minor version upgrades

Starting with the release of Redis 8.2 on Redis Cloud Pro, Redis Cloud will automatically upgrade your database to the latest minor version during maintenance windows. See [Redis version management]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/version-management" >}}) for more information.
