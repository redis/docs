## New features

### Block public endpoints

Users with Redis Cloud Pro databases can now choose to block public endpoints for all databases in their subscription. See [Block public endpoints]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/database-security/block-public-endpoints" >}}) for more information.

### Free database selection

You can now create a free database from the [Create a database]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-free-database" >}}) page. Free databases are perfect for learning and exploring Redis. You get 30 MB of space for you to learn Redis concepts and develop application prototypes.

You can only have one free database per account. If you already have a free database, you can [delete it]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/delete-database" >}}) or [upgrade it to a paid Essentials plan]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/view-essentials-subscription#upgrade-plan" >}}) before creating a new one.

## Enhancements

### Faster scaling with Redis hashing policy

Starting June 24, 2025, new Redis Cloud accounts can create databases that scale faster. This makes resharding operations up to 40% faster than before.

Faster scaling requires:
- A new Redis cloud account, created after June 24, 2025
- A new database running Redis 7.4 or later, with the [Redis hashing policy]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/clustering#redis-hashing-policy" >}}) selected

For these databases, this enhancement is enabled automatically, ensuring that all future resharding operations complete faster than ever.
