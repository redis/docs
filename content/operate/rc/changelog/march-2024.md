## New Features

### Fixed subscriptions through Google Cloud Marketplace

You can now use your [Google Cloud Marketplace]({{< relref "/operate/rc/cloud-integrations/gcp-marketplace/" >}}) account to pay for your Fixed subscriptions as well as your Flexible subscriptions. 

### Active-Passive with TLS

[Active-Passive]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/migrate-databases#sync-using-active-passive" >}}) now supports source databases that require connections over TLS. See [Migrate data]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/migrate-databases" >}}) for more information.
