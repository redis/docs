## New Features


### Query performance factor preview

When you create a Pro database with [Search and query]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search" >}}) capabilities, you can now choose to boost your query capabilities with the Query performance factor. The query performance factor adds dedicated power specifically for Search and query. For more information, see [Search and query sizing]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/configuration/advanced-capabilities#search-and-query-sizing" >}}).

You can take advantage of extra query speed for free during the preview period.

### Redis 7.4 Preview

A preview of Redis 7.4 is now available on [Redis Cloud Essentials databases]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/create-database/create-essentials-database" >}}) in select regions on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.

Redis 7.4 offers hash field expiration and other feature set improvements. For more information on the changes in Redis 7.4, see the [Redis 7.4 release blog post](https://redis.io/blog/announcing-redis-community-edition-and-redis-stack-74).
