## New features

### FOCUS-compliant cost reports with REST API

Select users can now generate and download [cost reports]({{< relref "/operate/rc/billing-and-payments/cost-report" >}}) in a [FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS)](https://focus.finops.org/) compliant format using the Redis Cloud REST API. You can use this cost report with any FOCUS-compatible cost reporting tool to analyze and visualize your costs.

[Contact support](https://redis.io/support/) to request access to the cost report endpoint.

See [Generate FOCUS-compliant cost report with REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/examples/generate-cost-report" >}}) for examples.
