Redis 7.4 offers hash field expiration and other feature set improvements. For more information on the changes in Redis 7.4, see [What's new in Redis 7.4]({{<relref "/develop/whats-new/7-4" >}}).

## Breaking changes

When new versions of Redis Community Edition change existing commands, upgrading your database to a new version can potentially break some functionality. Before you upgrade, read the provided list of breaking changes that affect Redis Cloud and update any applications that connect to your database to handle these changes.

If you're upgrading from Redis 6.4, also review the [Redis 7.2 breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rc/changelog/version-release-notes/7-2#breaking-changes" >}}) before upgrading.
