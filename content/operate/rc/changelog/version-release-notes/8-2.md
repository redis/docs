Redis 8.2 builds on the foundation of Redis 8.0 with significant performance and memory optimizations, enhanced streaming capabilities, and improved cluster management tools. For more information on the changes in Redis 8.2, see [What's new in Redis 8.2]({{<relref "/develop/whats-new/8-2" >}}) and review the Redis Open Source [8.2 release notes]({{<relref "/operate/oss-and-stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.2-release-notes" >}}).

Starting with the release of Redis 8.2 on Redis Cloud Pro, Redis Cloud will automatically upgrade your database to the latest minor version during maintenance windows. See [Redis version management]({{< relref "/operate/rc/databases/version-management" >}}) for more information.

## Breaking changes

When new versions of Redis Open Source change existing commands, upgrading your database to a new version can potentially break some functionality. Before you upgrade, read the provided list of breaking changes that affect Redis Cloud and update any applications that connect to your database to handle these changes.

If you are upgrading from Redis 7.4, review the [Redis 8.0 breaking changes]({{< relref "/operate/rc/changelog/version-release-notes/8-0#breaking-changes" >}}) before upgrading.
