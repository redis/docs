## New features

### New UI and dark mode

The Redis Cloud console has a refreshed user interface! You can now choose between light mode and dark mode when using the Redis Cloud console.

The new user interface and dark mode are currently available for selected accounts and will be gradually rolled out to new accounts over time.
