## New features

### New UI and dark mode

The Redis Cloud console has a refreshed user interface! You can now choose between light mode and dark mode when using the Redis Cloud console.

{{<image filename="images/rc/mode-select-dark.png#no-click" alt="Mode selection toggle with dark mode selected." class="inline" >}}

The new user interface and dark mode are currently available for selected accounts and will be gradually rolled out to new accounts over time.

### Map multiple Redis Cloud accounts to marketplace account

You can now map multiple Redis Cloud accounts to a single [Google Cloud Marketplace]({{< relref "/operate/rc/cloud-integrations/gcp-marketplace/" >}}) or [AWS Marketplace]({{< relref "/operate/rc/cloud-integrations/aws-marketplace/" >}}) account.
