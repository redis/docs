The **Access management** screen helps you manage:

- The team of users allowed to access your subscription and its databases.
- The API keys that authenticate application access to your account.
- [Single sign-on (SSO) with SAML]({{< relref "/operate/rc/security/access-control/saml-sso" >}}).

Here, you learn how to manage your team's users and control their level of access. 

For help managing API keys, see [Manage API keys]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/get-started/manage-api-keys" >}}).

## Manage team access

The **Team** tab lets you manage the people allowed to access your account. Each authorized person is assigned to a role that specifies their privileges.

{{<image filename="images/rc/access-management-team-tab.png" alt="The Access management tab helps you manage the people allowed to access your subscription." >}}

The list contains one entry summarizing the team settings for each user in your team. By default, the list includes the account owner.

The list includes several buttons and icons to help you manage the list:

| Icon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| {{<image filename="images/rc/button-access-management-add.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="Use the Add button to add members to your team." class="inline" >}} | The **Add** button lets you add members to your team |
| {{<image filename="images/rc/icon-access-management-edit-user.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="Use the Edit button change details for a team member." class="inline">}} | The **Edit** button lets you edit the settings for the selected team member |
| {{<image filename="images/rc/icon-access-management-delete-user.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="Use the Delete button to remove a member from your team." class="inline">}} | The **Delete** button lets you remove members from your team
| {{<image filename="images/rc/icon-list-filter.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="Use the Filter button to display team members that match specified conditions." class="inline">}} | **Filter** icons let you display team members matching conditions you specify |
| <nobr>{{<image filename="images/rc/icon-list-sort-asc.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="The Sort ascending button displays members in ascending order according to the values of the selected field." class="inline">}}{{<image filename="images/rc/icon-list-sort-desc.png#no-click" width="30px" alt="The Sort descending button displays members in descending order according to the values of the selected field." class="inline">}}</nobr> | The **Sort ascending** and **Sort descending** icons display the list according to the selected order |

If you have a large team, you can use the controls in the list footer to navigate quickly through the list. These controls are deactivated for small teams.

### Add user

When you add a member to your team, the **Add user** dialog appears.  

{{<image filename="images/rc/access-mgmt-add-user-dialog.png" width="50%" alt="Use the Add User dialog to specify the details for your new user." >}}

Use the dialog to specify these values.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **First name** | First name of the user displayed in the Redis Cloud console and in email messages |
| **Last name** | Last name of the user displayed in the Redis Cloud console and in email messages |
| **Role** | The role identifies their subscription and account privileges.  For details, see [Team management roles](#team-management-roles). |
| **Email** | The address used for alerts and other email messages regarding the account | 
| **Alert emails** | Enable to be notified when subscription databases cross certain thresholds, such as exceeding memory limits or latency requirements |
| **Operational emails** | Notifications about subscription and database changes, such as creating or deleting a database, and [subscription and database maintenance]({{< relref "/operate/rc/subscriptions/maintenance" >}}) |
| **Billing emails** | Notifications about billing, such as when bills are issued and paid |
| **Multi-factor authentication** | Whether MFA is enabled for the member.  This is deactivated when members have not enabled or confirmed MFA in their user profile settings. |

Use the **Add user** button to save your new team member details. 

Redis will send an activation email to the user once their details are saved. After following the activation link, they can sign in.

### Edit user

To edit user team details, select the user from the list and then select the **Edit** button.
The **Edit user** dialog displays the details you can change.  

{{<image filename="images/rc/access-mgmt-edit-user-dialog.png" width="50%" alt="Use the Edit User dialog to change the details for a user" >}}

You can change any detail except the team member's email address.

Select **Save user** to save your changes.

### Delete user

To remove a member from your team, select them from the list and then select the **Delete** button. A confirmation dialog appears.  

{{<image filename="images/rc/access-management-delete-user-dialog.png" width="50%" alt="Confirm that you want to remove a user from your team" >}}

Select **Delete user** to confirm removal. This is a permanent action that cannot be undone.

## Team management roles

Each team member is assigned a role that identifies their privileges and limits their activities in the Redis Cloud console.

Roles and responsibilities are:

- **Owner** can view, create, and edit any settings in the account.

    Each subscription must have at least one account owner. Accounts can have multiple owners.

    Owners can also manage subscriptions, databases, and API keys.

- **Billing Admin** can view and edit settings related to billing and payments.

    Billing Admins can add and remove payment methods and change the payment method for a subscription, but they cannot change any other subscription or database settings.

- **Manager** can view, create, and edit any setting in the subscription. 

    Managers can change subscription costs and change payment methods associated with a subscription, but they cannot add or remove available payment methods.

- **Member** can view, create, and edit databases in ways that do not impact costs.

    Members cannot create databases or edit databases in ways that impact costs.

- **Viewer** can view all databases and their configurations, including database secrets.

- **Logs viewer** can not access the Redis Cloud console. They are only allowed access to the [Redis Cloud API]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api" >}}) [`GET logs/`]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/api-reference#tag/Account/operation/getAccountSystemLogs" >}}) endpoint. 

This table shows each role's ability to perform common tasks.
