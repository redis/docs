If you have a Redis Cloud subscription, you can use a REST API to manage your subscription programmatically.

For security reasons, the Redis Cloud API is disabled by default.

To enable the API:

1. Sign in to your [Redis Cloud account](https://cloud.redis.io) as an account owner.
1. From the menu, choose **Access Management**.
1. When the **Access Management** screen appears, select the **API Keys** tab.

1. If a **Copy** button appears to the right of the API account key, the API is enabled.  This button copies the account key to the Clipboard.

    If you see an **Enable API** button, select it to enable the API and generate your API account key.

To authenticate REST API calls, you need to combine the API account key with an [API user key]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/get-started/manage-api-keys#api-user-keys" >}}) to make API calls.

Only account owners can see the access key in the account settings.

{{< warning >}}
Make sure that you keep your access keys secret. Anyone who sends an API request with a valid access key can make changes to your account.

To manage your API keys or to limit IP addresses for user keys, see [Manage API keys]({{< relref "/operate/rc/api/get-started/manage-api-keys.md" >}}).
