You can install [Redis CE]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/" >}}) locally on your machine. Redis CE is available on Docker, Linux, macOS, and Windows (using Docker only).

Here are the installation instructions:

* [Install Redis CE]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack" >}})

While you can install Redis CE locally, you might also consider using Redis Cloud by creating a [free account](https://redis.com/try-free/?utm_source=redisio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-09-try_free&utm_content=cu-redis_cloud_users). Redis CE 8.0 is not yet available on Redis Cloud.
