You can install [Redis Community Edition]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/" >}}) locally on your machine. Redis Community Edition is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Docker only). The latest version is Redis Community Edition 8.0.0 RC1.

Here are the installation instructions:

* [Install Redis]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis" >}})

While you can install Redis Community Edition locally, you might also consider using Redis Cloud by creating a [free account](https://redis.com/try-free/?utm_source=redisio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-09-try_free&utm_content=cu-redis_cloud_users). Redis Community Edition 8.0 is not yet available on Redis Cloud
