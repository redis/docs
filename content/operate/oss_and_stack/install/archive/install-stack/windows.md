To install Redis Stack on Windows, you will need to have Docker installed. When Docker is up and running, open Windows PowerShell and follow the instructions described in [Run Redis Stack on Docker]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/docker" >}}). Then, use Docker to connect with `redis-cli` as explained in that topic.

If you attempt to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Ubuntu for Windows to follow [Linux instructions]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/linux" >}}), you will get a `systemd` error telling you `System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.` Do not fret. Just use Docker. 

_`systemd` is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system._ For more information about its function, see [System and Service Manager](https://systemd.io/). This becomes an issue due to the lack of support for Linux workflows on WSL. But, you can test the instructions listed in [Systemd support is now available in WSL!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/). Let us know how that worked for you.
