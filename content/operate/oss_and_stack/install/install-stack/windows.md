## Run Redis Community Edition (CE) on Windows using Docker

To install Redis CE on Windows, you will need to have Docker installed. When Docker is up and running, open Windows PowerShell and follow the instructions described in [Run Redis CE on Docker]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/docker" >}}). Then, use Docker to connect with `redis-cli` as explained in that topic.
