While you can install Redis Open Source on any of the platforms listed below, you might also consider using Redis Cloud by creating a [free account](https://redis.com/try-free/?utm_source=redisio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-09-try_free&utm_content=cu-redis_cloud_users).

You can also download [Redis Insight]({{< relref "/operate/redisinsight/install/" >}}), a free developer companion tool with an intuitive GUI and advanced CLI, which you can use alongside Redis Open Source.
