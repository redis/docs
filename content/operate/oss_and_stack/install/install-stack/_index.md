While you can install Redis Community Edition (CE) on any of the platforms listed below, you might also consider using Redis Cloud by creating a [free account](https://redis.com/try-free/?utm_source=redisio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-09-try_free&utm_content=cu-redis_cloud_users).
Redis CE 8.0 is not yet available on Redis Cloud.
