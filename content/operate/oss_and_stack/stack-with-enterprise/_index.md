[Redis Enterprise Software]({{< relref "/operate/rs" >}}) and [Redis Cloud]({{< relref "/operate/rc" >}}) support all [Redis Stack]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/enterprise-capabilities" >}}) features, which extend the core Redis feature set. Some of the capabilities Redis Stack provides include querying, indexing, and full-text search and support for JSON, time series, and probabilistic data structures.
