### Headlines

RedisJSON 2.6 introduces support for RESP3 and new commands.

### What's new in 2.6

- Introduce [`JSON.MERGE`]({{< relref "/commands" >}}/json.merge) in compliance with [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), supporting:

  - Creating new attributes on an existing JSON document

  - Updating and replacing values in parent and child attributes

  - Deleting existing attributes (by setting the value to `null`)

  - Array update - replacing an entire array with the new value

- Introduce [`JSON.MSET`]({{< relref "/commands" >}}/json.mset/), supporting atomic multiple sets for keys in the same hash slot

- New `FORMAT` argument in `JSON.ARRPOP` and `JSON.GET` to retrieve the results as JSON strings or RESP3 hierarchical structures (RESP3 only)

- `JSON.RESP` is now regarded as deprecated

- Legacy paths (paths that don't start with either `$.` or `$[` or equal to `$`), except those starting with `.`, are now deprecated

{{<note>}}
- The version inside Redis will be 2.6.4 in semantic versioning. Since the version of a module in Redis is numeric, we could not add a GA flag.

- Minimal Redis version: 7.2
