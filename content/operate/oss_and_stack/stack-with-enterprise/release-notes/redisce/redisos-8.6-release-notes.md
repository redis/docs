## Redis Open Source 8.6.0 (February 2026)

This is the General Availability release of Redis 8.6 in Redis Open Source.

### Major changes compared to 8.4

- Substantial performance improvements.
- Substantial memory reduction for hashes (hashtable-encoded) and sorted sets (skiplist-encoded).
- Streams: `XADD` idempotency (at-most-once guarantee) with new `IDMPAUTO` and `IDMP` arguments.
- New eviction policies - least recently modified: `volatile-lrm` and `allkeys-lrm`.
- Hot keys detection and reporting; new command: `HOTKEYS`.
- TLS certificate-based automatic client authentication.
- Time series: support NaN values; new aggregators: `COUNTNAN` and `COUNTALL`.
