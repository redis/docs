## Redis Stack 7.2.0-v0 (August 2023)

This is a GA release of Redis Stack version 7.2.

### Headlines:
Redis server 7.2 introduces significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets, several improvements, including encoding improvements for sets and lists, stream consumer group improvements, and improved durability.
Search and Query brings the frequently asked Geo polygons queries for basic shapes and improved query performance on sorting in different scenarios. 
JSON introduces two new commands: [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) and [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) for more efficient data manipulation.
Preview of triggers and functions that allows developers to run JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.
Lastly, 7.2 adds the option to use the new protocol [RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) improving the response format for all commands.

**Redis server**:
Redis server 7.2 brings performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.

**Search and Query**:
This new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.

In addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.

**JSON**:
JSON introduces two new commands:
 - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.
 - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.

**Graph**:

Graph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).

> [!WARNING]  
If you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don't upgrade.

**Triggers and functions preview**:
Triggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.

Triggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.

Try it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).

a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap
corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all
versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects
only authenticated and authorized users.
  * ([CVE-2023-36824](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3)) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments
may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap
memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Specifically:
using COMMAND GETKEYS* and validation of key names in ACL rules.

## Redis Stack 7.2.0-rc2 (June 2023)

This is the second release of Redis Stack version 7.2.0.

### Headlines:
This version contains a new capability - **Triggers and Functions**, improvements to the **Search and Query** capability, and improvements to the **JSON**, **time series** and **probabilistic data structures**. It also includes the latest version of **RedisInsight**.

The new **Search and Query** version introduces new and frequently asked **Geo Polygon Search**. Adding the `GEOSHAPE` field type that supports polygon shapes using [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). Besides the current `GEO` (alias for `GEOPOINT`) used already geo range queries, we add the support for `POLYGON` as new shapes. In addition, it brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE`.

This release includes a new capability - [Triggers and Functions](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/tree/master) that brings the ability to execute and trigger business logic inside Redis using JavaScript (JS). Detailed documentation and examples can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears#redisgears-20). The Triggers and Functions commands are aligned with the Redis Functions command. The API is not yet final and might change based on feedback. **Any [feedback](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears) is highly appreciated.**
### Details:
**Features**
* **Search and Query**:
  * [[#3553](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3553)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3553) Introduce support for Geo-polygon shapes and queries
    * [[#3476](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3476)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3476), [[#3660](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3660)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3660) Adding `GEOSHAPE` [field type](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) to map polygons in the `SCHEMA` on `FT.CREATE`.
    * Support for polygons `POLYGON` using [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry), for example `POLYGON((x1 y1, x2 y2, ...))`.
    * [[#3556](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3556)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3556) Adjust the [query syntax](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) on `FT.SEARCH` for Polygons using the predicate `@geom:[OPERATOR $poly]` and defining polygon in WKT format as `PARAMS 2 poly "POLYGON((10 20, ...))"` using `DIALECT 3`.
    * Initially `WITHIN` and `CONTAINS` operators with `GEOSHAPES` for now.
    * [[#3645](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3645)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3645) Support multiple coordinate systems cartesian (X,Y) and geographic (lon, lat). Geographic coordinate system using spherical indexing as default (`SPHERICAL`).
  * [[#3046](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046) Introduce performance optimization for sorting operations on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` as default on `DIALECT 4`. It will improve performance in 4 different scenarios, listed below:
    * Skip Sorter - applied when there is no sort of any kind. The query can return once it reaches the `LIMIT` requested results.
    * Partial Range - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field, with no filter or filter by the same numeric field, the query iterate on a range large enough to satisfy the `LIMIT` requested results.
    * Hybrid - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field in addition to another non-numeric filter. Some results will get filtered, and the initial range may not be large enough. The iterator then is rewinded with the following ranges, and an additional iteration takes place to collect `LIMIT` requested results.
    * No optimization - If there is a sort by score or by non-numeric field, there is no other option but to retrieve all results and compare their values.
    * [[#3651](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3651)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3651) Add `WITHCOUNT` argument that allow return accurate counts for the query results with sorting. This operation processes all results in order to get accurate count, being less performant than the optimised option (default behaviour on `DIALECT 4`).


* **JSON**:
  * [[#916](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916)](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916) Introduce the new `JSON.MERGE` in compliance with [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), supporting:
    * Creating new attributes on an existing JSON document
    * Updating and replacing values in parent and child attributes
    * Deleting existing attributes (giving `null` as value)
    * Array update - replacing an entire array with the new value.
  * [[#944](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944)](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944) Introduce `JSON.MSET`, supporting atomic multiple sets for keys in the same hash slot.

* **Triggers and Functions**:
  * [[#875](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/875)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/875) The api_version was added to the library prologue indicating the minimum required API version. Indicating the library works on the specified API version and later minor versions.
[[#896](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/896)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/896) Additional optional callback on a KeySpace trigger that can perform read operations exactly when the notification happens.
  * [[#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) The JavaScript API is updated to be inline with JavaScript best practices. Registrations of functions and triggers is done with mandatory arguments and a single optional object.
  * [[#935](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/935)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/935) Ability to load an RDB from a Redis Server with the RedisGears module loaded but NOT used into a Redis Server without the RedisGears module.
  * Updated commands:
    * [[#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) `TFUNCTION` and `TFCALL` is used instead of `RG.FUNCTION` and `RG.FCALL`.
    * [[#939](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/939)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/939) The commands are updated to match the Redis Functions commands. `TFCALL` combines the library and function in a single argument with '.' separated. Example: `TFCALL <library_name>.<function_name>`.
    * [[#900](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/900)](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/900) rated the ability to run functions as a coroutine in `TFCALLASYNC`. Clients rely on `TFCALL` to never block shared connections so other commands are not delayed on such connections.


 **Improvements**

  * [[#916](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916)](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916) Introduce the new `JSON.MERGE` in compliance with [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), supporting:
    * Creating new attributes on an existing JSON document
    * Updating and replacing values in parent and child attributes
    * Deleting existing attributes (giving `null` as value)
    * Array update - replacing an entire array with the new value
  * [[#944](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944)](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944) Introduce `JSON.MSET`, supporting atomic multiple sets for keys in the same hash slot

 **Improvements**
* **Search and Query**:
  * [[#3628](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3628)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3628) Background indexing scanning performance

**Changed Behavior**
* **Search and Query**:
  * [[#3355](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3355)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3355) Expired keys deleted from the slave's index, returning an empty array instead of `nil`

**Bug Fixes**
* **Search and Query**:
  * [[#3562](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3562)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3562) Index definition may load several times when using `REPLICAOF` causing a failure
  * [[#3557](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3557)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3557) `TIMEOUT` configuration on `FT.AGGREGATE` query being ignored
  * [[#3606](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3606)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3606) Update numeric inverted index `numEntries` avoiding excessive memory consumption
  * [[#3552](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3552)](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3552) `FT.CURSOR READ` on `JSON` numeric queries not returning results

Note: version numbers follow the pattern:

`x.y.z-b`
* `x.y` Redis major version
* `z` increases with even numbers as a module x.y version increases.
* `b` denotes a patch to Redis or a module (any `z` of Redis or modules). `b` will consist of a `v` + numeric value.
