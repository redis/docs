Since 2009, the Redis open source project has inspired an enthusiastic and active community of users and contributors. We continue to be committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Original developer and core team

[Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://github.com/antirez) built, led, and maintained the Redis open source project. In 2020, Salvatore Sanfilippo named two successors to take over and lead the Redis project: Yossi Gottlieb [yossigo](https://github.com/yossigo) and Oran Agra [oranagra](https://github.com/oranagra). Salvatore [returned to Redis in 2024](https://antirez.com/news/144).

## Contributing to Redis

The Redis core source repository is hosted under [https://github.com/redis/redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) along with many of the client libraries. Commits to the Redis source repository will require code review, approval of at least one reviewer who is not the author of the commit, and no objections.

There are many ways to contribute to Redis, starting with documentation all the way to changes to the open source Redis server. Here are a few ways you can get involved.

### Contributing to docs

The [Redis docs](https://github.com/redis/docs) are open source, and we'd love to incorporate your contributions. For small changes and typos, we recommend working in a fork and creating a [pull request](https://github.com/redis/docs/pulls). Your first PR will prompt you to sign the contributor license agreement. Approved PRs will be published with the next batch of changes to the docs site.

### Reporting bugs

To report a bug in Redis, create a [Redis Github issue](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues).

For larger changes, we ask that you first create an issue describing your proposed changes. This is a good way to get feedback in advance to increase the likelihood that your changes will be accepted.

### Client libraries

The Redis [client libraries]({{< relref "/develop/clients" >}}) are nearly always open source and accepting of contributions. Consult the contribution guidelines for the library you're interested in.
