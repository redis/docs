When creating secrets for TLS or mTLS, ensure that all certificates and keys are in `PEM` format. The only exception to this is that for PostgreSQL, the private key `SOURCE_DB_KEY` secret must be in `DER` format. If you have a key in `PEM` format, you must convert it to `DER` before creating the `SOURCE_DB_KEY` secret using the command:

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform DER \
    -in /path/to/myclient.pem \
    -out /path/to/myclient.pk8 -nocrypt
```

This command assumes that the private key is not encrypted. See the [`openssl` documentation](https://docs.openssl.org/master/) to learn how to convert an encrypted private key.
