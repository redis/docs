A valid tag must follow these guidelines:
- Tag keys must be between 1 and 64 characters long, and values must be at least 1 character long.
- Tags can only have lowercase letters, numbers, spaces, and these special characters: `-`, `_`, `.`, `+`, `@`, and `:`.

After you add your first tag, you can:

- Select the **Key** or **Value** field of an existing tag and enter new text to edit it.

- Select **Delete** next to a tag to delete it.
