### When not to use RDI

RDI is not a good fit when:

- You are migrating an existing data set into Redis only once.
- Your app needs *immediate* cache consistency (or a hard limit on latency) rather
  than *eventual* consistency.
- You need *transactional* consistency between the source and target databases.
- The app must *write* data to the Redis cache, which then updates the source database
  (write-behind/write-through patterns).
- Your data set will only ever be small.
- Your data is updated by some batch or ETL process with long and large transactions - RDI will fail
  processing these changes.
- You need complex stream processing of data (aggregations, sliding window processing, complex 
  custom logic).
- You need to write data to multiple targets from the same pipeline (Redis supports other
  ways to replicate data across Redis databases such as replicaOf and Active-Active).
- Your database administrator has rejected RDI's requirements for the source database.
