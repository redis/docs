A Redis feature set includes a specific Redis database version along with the advanced capabilities and data structures provided by compatible module versions.

A database is not compatible with module versions from different feature set versions. If you want to use advanced capability features or data structures introduced by a later feature set version, you must upgrade your database to the compatible Redis version and module versions according to the following table.
