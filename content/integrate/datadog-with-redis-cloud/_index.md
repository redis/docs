[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to 
enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations, security and 
business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, secure applications and 
infrastructure, understand user behavior, and track key business metrics.

The Datadog Integration for Redis Cloud uses the Datadog Integration API to connect to Redis metrics exporters. 
The integration is based on Datadog's 
[OpenMetrics integration](https://datadoghq.dev/integrations-core/base/openmetrics/) in their core API. This integration 
enables Redis Cloud users to export metrics directly to Datadog for analysis, and includes Redis-designed 
dashboards for use in monitoring Redis Cloud clusters.

This integration makes it possible to:
- Collect and display metrics not available in the admin console
- Set up automatic alerts for node or cluster events
- Display these metrics alongside data from other systems

## Install Redis' Datadog Integration for Redis Cloud

Installing the Datadog integration is a two-step process. Firstly, the installation must be part of your configuration. 
Select 'Integrations' from the menu in the Datadog portal and then enter 'Redis' in the search bar, then select 
'Redis Cloud by Redis, Inc.'. Next click 'Install Integration' in the top-right corner of the overview page.

If you have not already created a VPC between the Redis Cloud cluster and the network in which the machine hosting the 
Datadog agent lives you should do so now. Please visit [VPC Peering](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rc/security/vpc-peering/) 
and follow the instructions for the cloud platform of your choice.

Returning to the Datadog console, open the 'Configure' tab of the integration and follow the instructions for installing 
the integration on the local machine. After it has been installed follow the instruction for adding an instance to the 
conf.yaml in /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/redis_cloud.d.

After you have edited the conf.yaml file please restart the service and check its status:

```shell
sudo service datadog-agent restart
```

followed by:

```shell
sudo service datadog-agent status
```

to be certain that the service itself is running and did not encounter any problems. Next, check the output of the 
service; in the terminal on the Datadog agent host run the following command:

```shell
tail -f /var/log/datadog/agent.log
```

It will take several minutes for data to reach Datadog. Finally, check the Datadog console by selecting 
Infrastructure -> Host Map from the menu and then finding the host that is monitoring the Redis Cloud instance. The host 
should be present, and in its list of components there should be a section called 'rdsc', which is the namespace used by 
the Redis Cloud integration, although this can take several minutes to appear. It is also possible to verify the metrics 
by choosing Metrics -> Explorer from the menu and entering 'rdsc.bdb_up'.

## View metrics

The Redis Cloud Integration for Datadog contains pre-defined dashboards to aid in monitoring your Redis Cloud deployment.

The following dashboards are currently available:

- Overview
- Database
- Network

A number of additional dashboards will be included in the next release (v1.1.0).

## Monitor metrics

See [Observability and monitoring guidance]({{< relref "/integrate/prometheus-with-redis-enterprise/observability" >}}) for monitoring details.
