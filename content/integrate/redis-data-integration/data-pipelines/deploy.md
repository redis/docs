The sections below explain how to deploy a pipeline after you have created the required
[configuration]({{< relref "/integrate/redis-data-integration/data-pipelines/data-pipelines" >}}).

## Set secrets

Before you deploy your pipeline, you must set the authentication secrets for the
source and target databases. Each secret has a corresponding property name that
you can pass to the
[`redis-di set-secret`]({{< relref "/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/redis-di-set-secret" >}})
command to set the property's value. You can then refer to these properties
in `config.yaml` using the syntax "`${PROPERTY_NAME}`"
(the sample [config.yaml file](#the-configyaml-file) shows these properties in use).
For example, you would use the
following command line to set the source database username to `myUserName`:

```bash
redis-di set-secret SOURCE_DB_USERNAME myUserName
```

The table below shows the property name for each secret. Note that the
username and password are required for the source and target, but the other
secrets are only relevant to TLS/mTLS connections.

| Property name | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `SOURCE_DB_USERNAME` | Username for the source database |
| `SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD` | Password for the source database |
| `SOURCE_DB_CACERT` | (For TLS only) Source database trust certificate |
| `SOURCE_DB_KEY` | (For mTLS only) Source database private key |
| `SOURCE_DB_CERT` | (For mTLS only) Source database public key |
| `SOURCE_DB_KEY_PASSWORD` | (For mTLS only) Source database private key password |
| `TARGET_DB_USERNAME` | Username for the target database |
| `TARGET_DB_PASSWORD` | Password for the target database |
| `TARGET_DB_CACERT` | (For TLS only) Target database trust certificate |
| `TARGET_DB_KEY` | (For mTLS only) Target database private key |
| `TARGET_DB_CERT` | (For mTLS only) Target database public key |
| `TARGET_DB_KEY_PASSWORD` | (For mTLS only) Target database private key password |

## Deploy a pipeline

When you have created your configuration, including the [jobs]({{< relref "/integrate/redis-data-integration/data-pipelines/data-pipelines#job-files" >}}), use the
[`redis-di deploy`]({{< relref "/integrate/redis-data-integration/reference/cli/redis-di-deploy" >}})
command to deploy them:

```bash
redis-di deploy --dir <path to pipeline folder>
```

You can also deploy a pipeline using [Redis Insight]({{< relref "/develop/connect/insight/rdi-connector" >}}).
