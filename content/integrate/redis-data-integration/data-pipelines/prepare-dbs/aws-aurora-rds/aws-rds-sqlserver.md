Follow the steps in the sections below to prepare a [Microsoft SQL Server on AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.SQLServer.html) database to work with RDI.

{{< note >}}
Change Data Capture (CDC) is not supported on SQL Server Express Edition. Only the Standard, Enterprise, and Developer editions support CDC and are supported by RDI.

## Create the Debezium user

The Debezium connector needs a user account to connect to SQL Server. This
user must have appropriate permissions on all databases where you want Debezium
to capture changes.

1. Connect to your database as an admin user and create a new user for the connector:

    ```sql
    USE master
    GO
    CREATE LOGIN <username> WITH PASSWORD = '<password>'
    GO
    USE <database>
    GO
    CREATE USER <username> FOR LOGIN <username>
    GO
    ```

    Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with a username and password for the new user and replace `<database>` with the name of your database.

1. Grant the user the necessary permissions:

    ```sql
    USE master
    GO
    GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO <username>
    GO
    USE <database>
    GO
    EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'<username>'
    GO
    ```

    Replace `<username>` with the username of the Debezium user and replace `<database>` with the name of your database.

## Enable CDC on the database

Change Data Capture (CDC) must be enabled for the database and for each table you want to capture.

1. Enable CDC for the database by running the following command:

    ```sql
    EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_cdc_enable_db '<database>'
    GO
    ```

    Replace `<database>` with the name of your database.

1. Enable CDC for each table you want to capture by running the following commands:

    ```sql
    USE <database>
    GO
    EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
    @source_schema = N'<schema>',
    @source_name   = N'<table>', 
    @role_name     = N'<role>',
    @supports_net_changes = 0
    GO
    ```

    Replace `<database>` with the name of your database, `<schema>` with the name of the schema containing the table, `<table>` with the name of the table, and `<role>` with the name of a new role that will be created to manage access to the CDC data. 

    {{< note >}}
The value for `@role_name` canâ€™t be a fixed database role, such as `db_datareader`. 
Specifying a new name will create a corresponding database role that has full access to the
captured change data.

1. Add the Debezium user to the CDC role:

    ```sql
    USE <database>
    GO
    EXEC sp_addrolemember N'<role>', N'<username>'
    GO
    ```

    Replace `<role>` with the name of the role you created in the previous step and replace `<username>` with the username of the Debezium user.
