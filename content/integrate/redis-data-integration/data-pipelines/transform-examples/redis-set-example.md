In the example below, data is captured from the source table named `invoice` and is written to a Redis set. The `connection` is an optional parameter that refers to the corresponding connection name defined in `config.yaml`. When you specify the
`data_type` parameter for the job, it overrides the system-wide setting `target_data_type` defined in `config.yaml`. 

When writing to a set, you must supply an extra argument, `member`, which specifies the field that will be written. In this case, the result will be a Redis set with key names based on the key expression (for example, `invoices:Germany`, `invoices:USA`) and with an expiration of 100 seconds. If you don't supply an `expire` parameter, the keys will never expire.    

```yaml
source:
  server_name: chinook
  schema: public
  table: invoice
output:
  - uses: redis.write
    with:
      connection: target
      data_type: set
      key:
        expression: concat(['invoices:', BillingCountry])
        language: jmespath
      args:
        member: InvoiceId
      expire: 100
```
