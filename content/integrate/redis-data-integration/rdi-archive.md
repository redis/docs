RDI is now in general availability but you can still access an
[archived version of the docs for the preview version](https://docs.redis.com/rdi-preview/rdi/)
if you need to refer to them. Note that these docs will not be updated and
information in the current docs supersedes the content of the preview docs.

There is also another RDI product, **Write-behind**, that is still in preview.
See the [Write-behind]({{< relref "/integrate/write-behind" >}}) docs for
more information.
