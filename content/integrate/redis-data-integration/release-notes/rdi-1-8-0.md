RDIâ€™s mission is to help Redis customers sync Redis Enterprise with live data from their slow disk-based databases to:

- Meet the required speed and scale of read queries and provide an excellent and predictable user experience.
- Save resources and time when building pipelines and coding data transformations.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership by saving money on expensive database read replicas.

RDI keeps the Redis cache up to date with changes in the primary database, using a [_Change Data Capture (CDC)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) mechanism.
It also lets you _transform_ the data from relational tables into convenient and fast data structures that match your app's requirements. You specify the transformations using a configuration system, so no coding is required.

## Headlines

- Enhanced RDI operator for better pipeline orchestration, resiliency, observability, and flexibility. It 
  will also enable many new features in the near future.
- You can now use an external collector that is not managed by RDI but writes into RDI streams
  (Debezium compatible).
- You can now add labels and annotations to RDI data plane pods, for example to control service
  mesh features.
- RDI now uses a custom image of Debezium (based on `3.0.8.Final`) to address known vulnerabilities.
- Added support for calculated TTL for target database keys via `expire` expressions.

## Detailed changes

### Helm chart changes

- All collector and processor values that were previously under `collector`, `collectorSourceMetricsExporter`, and `processor` have been moved to `operator.dataPlane.collector` and `operator.dataPlane.processor`.
- `global.collectorApiEnabled` has been moved to `operator.dataPlane.collectorApi.enabled`, and is now a boolean value (`true` or `false`), not `"0"` or `"1"`.
- `api.authEnabled` is also now a boolean value, not `"0"` or `"1"`.
- The following values have been deprecated: `rdiMetricsExporter.service.protocol`, `rdiMetricsExporter.service.port`, `rdiMetricsExporter.serviceMonitor.path`, `api.service.name`
- You can now add custom labels and annotations to all RDI components.
- You can now disable the creation of the RDI system secrets.

### Operator Improvements

The RDI operator has been significantly enhanced in the following areas:

- **Resilience**: The operator now always maintains the desired pipeline state. Manual changes or random disruptions are reverted automatically.
- **Automatic recovery**: When a configuration issue is resolved, the entire pipeline starts automatically, eliminating the need for manual redeployment.
- **Consistency**: A pipeline that has been stopped with `stop` will remain stopped after `deploy` or `reset`, until explicitly started again.
- **Enhanced configuration**: You can now configure data plane components in ways that were previously not supported, such as adding labels and annotations.
- **External collector support**: No collector resources are created for sources of type `external`.
- **Enhanced troubleshooting**: You can now gain extra insight into the pipeline state by examining the `Pipeline` and `PipelineRelease` custom K8s resources.

### Other Features, Improvements and Enhancements

- Added `expire` expression for target output in transformation jobs.
- Addressed security vulnerabilities: TLS certificate hostname verification is now ON by default.
- Improved Helm default values while preserving `values.yaml` formatting.
- Enhanced Helm values and templates for better configuration.
- Added a script to create or update secrets when using Helm (`rdi-secret.sh` in the Helm zip file).
- Improved validation schema and ensured backward compatibility.
- Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of `requests` and `urllib3`.
- Improved error messages for JSON schema validation.
- Improved PostgreSQL documentation for mTLS.
- Added timestamps to the `status` command.
- Fixed issues with `primary_key` and `unique_constraint` attributes in Oracle metadata.
- Added `capture.mode` to MongoDB scaffolding.
- Improved Helm TLS setup for RDI database connections.
- Enhanced error handling and validation for transformation jobs.
- Improved documentation for supported platforms and configurations.

### Fixes

- Fixed HTTP 500 error when querying columns with tables parameter.
- Improved Helm TLS setup for RDI database connections.
- Fixed keystore overwrite when using mTLS on both source and RDI DBs in the collector.

## Limitations

RDI can write data to a Redis Active-Active database. However, it doesn't support writing data to two or more Active-Active replicas. Writing data from RDI to several Active-Active replicas could easily harm data integrity as RDI is not synchronous with the source database commits.
