RDIâ€™s mission is to help Redis customers sync Redis Enterprise with live data from their slow disk-based databases to:

- Meet the required speed and scale of read queries and provide an excellent and predictable user experience.
- Save resources and time when building pipelines and coding data transformations.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership by saving money on expensive database read replicas.

RDI keeps the Redis cache up to date with changes in the primary database, using a [_Change Data Capture (CDC)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) mechanism.
It also lets you _transform_ the data from relational tables into convenient and fast data structures that match your app's requirements. You specify the transformations using a configuration system, so no coding is required.

## What's New in 1.14.0

- Unified MySQL connector now handles both MySQL and MariaDB databases consistently
- Introduced Google Cloud Spanner support with both Google SQL and PostgreSQL dialect compatibility
- Introduced Apache Flink collector with built-in TLS/mTLS support for Google Spanner integration
- Fixed TLS certificate management issue for MySQL and MariaDB databases
- Better handling of CA certificate files in deployment configurations
- New metrics aggregator component for centralized metrics collection and exposure
- Enhanced operator metrics with proper exposure and monitoring capabilities
- Improved statistics endpoints adapted for Flink collector architecture
- Improved `redis-di status` command performance - introduced breakdown of "Processing Time" into "Transform time" and "Write time"

## Limitations

RDI can write data to a Redis Active-Active database. However, it doesn't support writing data to two or more Active-Active replicas. Writing data from RDI to several Active-Active replicas could easily harm data integrity as RDI is not synchronous with the source database commits.
