RDIâ€™s mission is to help Redis customers sync Redis Enterprise with live data from their slow disk-based databases to:

- Meet the required speed and scale of read queries and provide an excellent and predictable user experience.
- Save resources and time when building pipelines and coding data transformations.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership by saving money on expensive database read replicas.

RDI keeps the Redis cache up to date with changes in the primary database, using a [_Change Data Capture (CDC)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) mechanism.
It also lets you _transform_ the data from relational tables into convenient and fast data structures that match your app's requirements. You specify the transformations using a configuration system, so no coding is required.

## What's New in 1.14.0

- Added support for Google Cloud Spanner databases:
  - Compatible with both Google SQL and PostgreSQL dialects
  - Secure data collection through Apache Flink with built-in TLS/mTLS support
- Fixing: MariaDB TLS connection not working when using TLS to the RDI database
- Introduced RDI operator metrics for better monitoring and troubleshooting of the work of the operator
- The `redis-di status` command now shows a detailed breakdown of the processor processing times:
  - Separate `Transform time` metric showing how long data transformations take
  - Distinct `Write time` metric indicating Redis write operation duration

## Limitations

RDI can write data to a Redis Active-Active database. However, it doesn't support writing data to two or more Active-Active replicas. Writing data from RDI to several Active-Active replicas could easily harm data integrity as RDI is not synchronous with the source database commits.
