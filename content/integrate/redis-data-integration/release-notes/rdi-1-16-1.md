{{< note >}}This maintenance release replaces the 1.16.0 release.{{< /note >}}

RDI's mission is to help Redis customers sync Redis Enterprise with live data from their slow disk-based databases to:

- Meet the required speed and scale of read queries and provide an excellent and predictable user experience.
- Save resources and time when building pipelines and coding data transformations.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership by saving money on expensive database read replicas.

RDI keeps the Redis cache up to date with changes in the primary database, using a [_Change Data Capture (CDC)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) mechanism.
It also lets you _transform_ the data from relational tables into convenient and fast data structures that match your app's requirements. You specify the transformations using a configuration system, so no coding is required.

## What's New in 1.16.1

- **Improved CA certificate chain handling from external secrets**: When importing CA certificates from external secrets mounts, RDI now correctly loads the full certificate chain instead of only the first certificate. This ensures proper trust configuration for TLS connections that rely on intermediate CAs.
- **More flexible API v2 pipeline patching**: Fixed API v2 pipeline PATCH behavior so that you can remove tables and table properties by sending `null` values. This aligns the API with the documented semantics for partial updates and makes it easier to clean up pipeline configurations.
- **Security hardening for collector API dependencies**: Updated the collector API to newer, supported versions of key dependencies to address multiple CVEs and improve overall security posture, including:
  - Spring Boot (to 3.3.11), which also brings updated Spring Framework and Spring Security components.
  - Netty (to 4.1.125.Final).
  - Kafka clients (to 3.9.1).
  - MySQL Connector/J (to 8.2.0).
  - Logback (to 1.5.18) and Jetty (to 12.0.19) via the Spring Boot upgrade.

## Limitations

RDI can write data to a Redis Active-Active database. However, it doesn't support writing data to two or more Active-Active replicas. Writing data from RDI to several Active-Active replicas could easily harm data integrity as RDI is not synchronous with the source database commits.
