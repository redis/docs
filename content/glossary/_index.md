{{%definition "obsolete"%}}
When features are removed from our products, they're generally replaced by new features that provide a better experience, more functionality, improved security, and other benefits.

To provide a transition period, we mark older features as _deprecated_ when introducing replacement features.  This gives you time to adjust your deployments, apps, and processes to support the new features.  During this transition, the older features continue to work as a courtesy.

Eventually, older features are removed from the product.  When this happens, they're considered _obsolete_, partly because they can no longer be used.

For best results, we advise against relying on deprecated features for any length of time.

{{%definition "sharding"%}}
Technique that has been used to scale larger data storage and processing loads. Sharding take your data, partitions it into smaller pieces and then send the data to different locations depending on which partition the data has been assigned to. Related to [hash slots]({{<relref "#hash-slot">}}) and [shards]({{<relref "#shard">}}).

{{%definition "snapshot (RDB)"%}}
Data persistence file that performs a data dump every one, six, or twelve hours. Used alongside [append-only file (AoF)]({{<relref "#append-only-file-aof">}}) for data persistence.

{{%definition "time series"%}}
A sequence of data points indexed in time order. Redis provides native time series support through RedisTimeSeries for storing and querying time-stamped data.
