{{%definition "obsolete"%}}
When features are removed from our products, they're generally replaced by new features that provide a better experience, more functionality, improved security, and other benefits.

To provide a transition period, we mark older features as _deprecated_ when introducing replacement features.  This gives you time to adjust your deployments, apps, and processes to support the new features.  During this transition, the older features continue to work as a courtesy.

Eventually, older features are removed from the product.  When this happens, they're considered _obsolete_, partly because they can no longer be used.

For best results, we advise against relying on deprecated features for any length of time.
